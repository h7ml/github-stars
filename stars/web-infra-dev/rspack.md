Thanks to:

-   The webpack team and community for creating a great bundler and ecosystem from which we draw a lot of inspiration.
-   @sokra for the great work on the webpack project.
-   @ScriptedAlchemy for creating Module Federation and helping Rspack connect with the community.
-   The SWC project created by @kdy1, which powers Rspack's code parsing, transformation and minification.
-   The esbuild project created by @evanw, which inspired the concurrent architecture of Rspack.
-   The NAPI-RS project created by @Brooooooklyn, which powers Rspack's node-binding implementation.
