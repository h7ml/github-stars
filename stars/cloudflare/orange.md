Orange Meets is a demo application built using Cloudflare Calls. To build your own WebRTC application using Cloudflare Calls, get started in the Cloudflare Dashboard.

Simpler examples can be found here.

Architecture Diagram
--------------------

Variables
---------

Go to the Cloudflare Calls dashboard and create an application.

Put these variables into `.dev.vars`

```
CALLS_APP_ID=<APP_ID_GOES_HERE>
CALLS_APP_SECRET=<SECRET_GOES_HERE>
```

### Optional variables

The following variables are optional:

-   `MAX_WEBCAM_BITRATE` (default `1200000`): the maximum bitrate for each meeting participant's webcam.
-   `MAX_WEBCAM_FRAMERATE` (default: `24`): the maximum number of frames per second for each meeting participant's webcam.
-   `MAX_WEBCAM_QUALITY_LEVEL` (default `1080`): the maximum resolution for each meeting participant's webcam, based on the smallest dimension (i.e. the default is 1080p).

To customise these variables, place replacement values in `.dev.vars` (for development) and in the `[vars]` section of `wrangler.toml` (for the deployment).

Development
-----------

npm install
npm run dev

Open up http://127.0.0.1:8787 and you should be ready to go!

Deployment
----------

1.  Make sure you've installed `wrangler` and are logged in by running:

wrangler login

1.  Update `CALLS_APP_ID` in `wrangler.toml` to use your own Calls App ID
    
2.  You will also need to set the token as a secret by running:
    

wrangler secret put CALLS\_APP\_SECRET

or to programmatically set the secret, run:

echo REPLACE\_WITH\_YOUR\_SECRET | wrangler secret put CALLS\_APP\_SECRET

1.  Optionally, you can also use Cloudflare's TURN Service by setting the `TURN_SERVICE_ID` variable in `wrangler.toml` and `TURN_SERVICE_TOKEN` secret using `wrangler secret put TURN_SERVICE_TOKEN`
    
2.  Finally you can run the following to deploy
    

npm run deploy
