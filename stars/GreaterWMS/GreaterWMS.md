GreaterWMS
==========

Fully Open Source Warehouse Management System

The original vision for this software was to make it a framework that would facilitate warehouse management software development for everyone. However, we later discovered that we had written it as a complete software system, which was not what we intended.

Therefore, we have rewritten the underlying layer using Rust and Python as the carrier, creating a new CLI underlying framework called Bomiot. It offers high performance and more convenient development, fully leveraging Python's inherent language advantages.

The old version of GreaterWMS files can be found here: GreaterWMS v2.1.49

GreaterWMS will also use Bomiot for its 3.0 reconstruction.
