**üåü Show Cases | üöÄ Quick Start | üìÉ Tutorial | üí¨ Discussion | üôã FAQ**

üéâ Introduction
---------------

KTransformers, pronounced as Quick Transformers, is designed to enhance your ü§ó Transformers experience with advanced kernel optimizations and placement/parallelism strategies.  
  
KTransformers is a flexible, Python-centric framework designed with extensibility at its core. By implementing and injecting an optimized module with a single line of code, users gain access to a Transformers-compatible interface, RESTful APIs compliant with OpenAI and Ollama, and even a simplified ChatGPT-like web UI.  
  
Our vision for KTransformers is to serve as a flexible platform for experimenting with innovative LLM inference optimizations. Please let us know if you need any other features.

To install KTransformers, follow the official Installation Guide.

üìÉ Brief Injection Tutorial
---------------------------

At the heart of KTransformers is a user-friendly, template-based injection framework. This allows researchers to easily replace original torch modules with optimized variants. It also simplifies the process of combining multiple optimizations, allowing the exploration of their synergistic effects.  

Given that vLLM already serves as a great framework for large-scale deployment optimizations, KTransformers is particularly focused on local deployments that are constrained by limited resources. We pay special attention to heterogeneous computing opportunities, such as GPU/CPU offloading of quantized models. For example, we support the efficient Llamafile and Marlin kernels for CPU and GPU, respectively. More details can be found here.

### Example Usage

To utilize the provided kernels, users only need to create a YAML-based injection template and add the call to \`optimize\_and\_load\_gguf\` before using the Transformers model.

with torch.device("meta"):
    model \= AutoModelForCausalLM.from\_config(config, trust\_remote\_code\=True)
optimize\_and\_load\_gguf(model, optimize\_config\_path, gguf\_path, config)
...
generated \= prefill\_and\_generate(model, tokenizer, input\_tensor.cuda(), max\_new\_tokens\=1000)

In this example, the AutoModel is first initialized on the meta device to avoid occupying any memory resources. Then, `optimize_and_load_gguf` iterates through all sub-modules of the model, matches rules specified in your YAML rule file, and replaces them with advanced modules as specified.

After injection, the original `generate` interface is available, but we also provide a compatible `prefill_and_generate` method, which enables further optimizations like CUDAGraph to improve generation speed.

### How to custom your model

A detailed tutorial of the injection and multi-GPU using DeepSeek-V2 as an example is given here.

Below is an example of a YAML template for replacing all original Linear modules with Marlin, an advanced 4-bit quantization kernel.

\- match:
    name: "^model\\\\.layers\\\\..\*$"  # regular expression 
    class: torch.nn.Linear  # only match modules matching name and class simultaneously
  replace:
    class: ktransformers.operators.linear.KTransformerLinear  # optimized Kernel on quantized data types
    device: "cpu"   # which devices to load this module when initializing
    kwargs:
      generate\_device: "cuda"
      generate\_linear\_type: "QuantizedLinearMarlin"

Each rule in the YAML file has two parts: `match` and `replace`. The `match` part specifies which module should be replaced, and the `replace` part specifies the module to be injected into the model along with the initialization keywords.

You can find example rule templates for optimizing DeepSeek-V2 and Qwen2-57B-A14, two SOTA MoE models, in the ktransformers/optimize/optimize\_rules directory. These templates are used to power the `local_chat.py` demo.

Acknowledgment and Contributors
-------------------------------

The development of KTransformers is based on the flexible and versatile framework provided by Transformers. We also benefit from advanced kernels such as GGUF/GGML, Llamafile, Marlin, sglang and flashinfer. We are planning to contribute back to the community by upstreaming our modifications.

KTransformers is actively maintained and developed by contributors from the MADSys group at Tsinghua University and members from Approaching.AI. We welcome new contributors to join us in making KTransformers faster and easier to use.
