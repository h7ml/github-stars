🚩 **Get Started with CloudBase AI ToolKit**

🚀 Recommended: CloudBase AI CLI (Simplest)
-------------------------------------------

CloudBase AI CLI is a unified command-line tool that integrates multiple mainstream AI programming tools, supporting built-in models and custom models. It allows you to use Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, aider, Qwen Code, and other AI programming assistants with a simple command, while built-in CloudBase AI Toolkit supports the complete workflow from development to deployment, and can run in any environment.

**Core Advantages:**

-   🏗️ **Unified Management** - One command to manage multiple AI programming CLI tools, no need to switch between tools
-   🤖 **Multi-Model Support** - Support for built-in and custom large models, including Kimi K2, Zhipu GLM-4.5, etc.
-   🚀 **One-Click Development & Deployment** - Complete workflow from code generation to cloud deployment, supporting Web apps, mini-programs, and backend services
-   🌍 **Everywhere** - Can run in any environment, including mini-program developer tools, VS Code, GitHub Actions, etc.

**One-Click Installation**

# Mac/Linux/Windows WSL
curl https://static.cloudbase.net/cli/install/install.sh -fsS | bash

# Windows PowerShell
irm https://static.cloudbase.net/cli/install/install.ps1 | iex

**Start Using**

tcb ai

On first launch, the configuration wizard will guide you through AI tool selection and configuration. After configuration, you can start using AI tools for assisted development. You can run `tcb ai --setup` later to switch tools and models.

🛠️ Other IDE Configuration Methods
-----------------------------------

If you use other AI IDEs, please refer to the configuration guides below:

* * *

🚀 Quick Start
--------------

### 0\. Prerequisites

Install an AI development tool

For example, Cursor | WindSurf | CodeBuddy, etc. See the Supported AI IDE List.

Enable CloudBase Environment

Visit the Tencent CloudBase Console to enable your environment. New users can try it for free.

Install Node.js v18.15.0 or above

Make sure your computer has Node.js v18.15.0 or above. Download the latest version from the Node.js official site.

Optional: Set npm registry

To speed up dependency downloads, set npm registry to Tencent mirror. Run in your terminal:

npm config set registry https://mirrors.cloud.tencent.com/npm/

This will speed up downloads, especially in mainland China.

Optional: Clear npx cache Due to a bug in npx, you may need to clear its cache if you encounter installation issues. Run:

```
npx clear-npx-cache
```

### 1\. Initialize or Enhance Your Project

We provide project templates with best CloudBase practices and AI IDE rules. Two recommended ways:

#### 🚀 For New Projects

Choose a template and initialize in one click:

-   **WeChat Mini-Program + CloudBase**  
    Download Code ｜ Source Code
    
-   **React Web App + CloudBase**  
    Download Code ｜ Source Code
    
-   **Vue Web App + CloudBase**  
    Download Code ｜ Source Code
    
-   **UniApp Cross-Platform + CloudBase**  
    Download Code ｜ Source Code
    
-   **Universal CloudBase Template**: Not limited to any language or framework, includes CloudBase AI rules and MCP, suitable for any CloudBase project
    
    Download Code ｜ Source Code
    

#### 🛠️ Enhance Existing Projects

If you already have a project, after configuring MCP, just tell the AI "Download CloudBase AI rules in the current project" to automatically download and complete the AI editor rule configuration in your project directory.

If you only want to download specific IDE config files to avoid project file confusion, you can specify the IDE type:

```
Download CloudBase AI rules in the current project, only include Cursor config
Download CloudBase AI rules in the current project, only include WindSurf config
Download CloudBase AI rules in the current project, only include Claude Code config
```

### 2\. Configure Your AI IDE

Tip

If you use a template project, all configs are preset. If not, follow the instructions below to add the required config manually.

### 3\. Start Developing

Before you start, just tell the AI:

```
Login to CloudBase
```

The AI will automatically pop up the Tencent Cloud login and environment selection.

To switch environments later, say:

```
Logout CloudBase
```

The AI will clear the local config. You can ask the AI to login again anytime.

After login, you can confirm the AI is connected:

```
Query current CloudBase environment info
```

Describe your requirements to the AI and start developing:

```
Build a two-player online Gomoku game website, support online battle, and deploy it
```

The AI will automatically:

-   📝 Generate frontend and backend code
-   🚀 Deploy to CloudBase
-   🔗 Return the online access link

If you encounter errors during development, send the error message to the AI for troubleshooting:

```
There was an error: xxxx
```

You can also ask the AI to debug and modify code using cloud function logs:

```
The cloud function code does not meet the requirements, the requirement is xxx, please check the logs and data for debugging and fix it
```
