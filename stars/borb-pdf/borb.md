borb
====

`borb` is a powerful and flexible Python library for creating and manipulating PDF files.

üìñ Overview
-----------

`borb` provides a pure Python solution for PDF document management, allowing users to read, write, and manipulate PDFs. It models PDF files in a JSON-like structure, using nested lists, dictionaries, and primitives (numbers, strings, booleans, etc.). Created and maintained as a solo project, `borb` prioritizes common PDF use cases for practical and straightforward usage.

‚ú® Features
----------

Explore `borb`‚Äôs capabilities in the examples repository for practical, real-world applications, including:

-   PDF Metadata Management (reading, editing)
-   Text and Image Extraction
-   Adding Annotations (notes, links)
-   Content Manipulation (adding text, images, tables, lists)
-   Page Layout Management with `PageLayout`

‚Ä¶and much more!

üöÄ Installation
---------------

Install `borb` directly via `pip`:

pip install borb

üëã Getting Started: Hello World
-------------------------------

Create your first PDF in just a few lines of code with `borb`:

from pathlib import Path
from borb.pdf import Document, Page, PageLayout, SingleColumnLayout, Paragraph, PDF

\# Create an empty Document
d: Document \= Document()

\# Create an empty Page
p: Page \= Page()
d.append\_page(p)

l: PageLayout \= SingleColumnLayout(p)

\# Add a Paragraph
l.append\_layout\_element(Paragraph('Hello World!'))

\# Write the PDF
PDF.write(what\=d, where\_to\="assets/output.pdf")
