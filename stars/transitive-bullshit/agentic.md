Agentic
=======

You can think of Agentic as **RapidAPI for LLM tools**.

All tools listed on Agentic's marketplace have been carefully hand curated and are regularly tested with a comprehensive set of integration tests and evals. **Agentic aims for quality, not quantity**.

On the flip side, Agentic makes it easy to **publish your own MCP servers & OpenAPI services** to Agentic's MCP Gateway and instantly start charging for agentic tool use.

Key features
------------

-   **Highly Curated Tools**: All publicly listed Agentic tools are manually vetted to keep an extremely high quality bar.
-   **Agentic UX**: All Agentic tools have been hand-crafted specifically for LLM tool use. We call this Agentic UX, and it's at the heart of why Agentic tools work better for LLM & MCP use cases than legacy APIs.
-   **First-Class MCP Support**: On both the publishing and consumption sides, Agentic supports MCP as a truly first-class primitive – not an afterthought.
-   **World-Class TypeScript DX**: Agentic is written in TS and strives for a Vercel-like DX, including one-line integrations with every major TS LLM SDK.
-   **Stripe Billing**: Agentic uses Stripe for billing, and most tools are _usage-based_, so you'll only pay for what you (and your agents) actually use.
-   **Blazing Fast MCP Gateway**: Agentic's MCP gateway is powered by _Cloudflare's global edge network_. Tools come with customizable caching and rate-limits, so you can REST assured that your agents will always have a fast and reliable experience.
-   **Semver**: All Agentic tools are versioned using semver, so you can choose how to handle breaking changes.
