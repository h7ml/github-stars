/ˈniːmiː/ - Snapshot testing utilities for Elixir
=================================================

demo.mp4

Mneme augments `ExUnit.Assertions` with a set of assertions that know how to update themselves. This is sometimes called snapshot, approval, or golden master testing.

With Mneme, you write something like...

auto\_assert my\_function()

...and next time you run your tests, Mneme:

1.  runs the code,
2.  generates a pattern from the result,
3.  prints a diff,
4.  and asks if you'd like the test updated.

When you say yes, your test now looks like this:

auto\_assert %MyAwesomeValue{so: :cool} <- my\_function()

This lets you quickly write lots of tests, and like ordinary tests, you'll see when they fail. But, unlike ordinary tests, Mneme asks if you'd like the test updated for the new value.

**Features:**

-   **Auto-updating assertions:** maintain correct tests as behavior changes during development.
-   **Alternatives to familiar assertions:** `auto_assert`, `auto_assert_raise`, `auto_assert_receive`, `auto_assert_received`.
-   **Seamless integration with ExUnit:** no need to change your workflow, just run `mix test`.
-   **Interactive prompts in your terminal** when a new assertion is added or an existing one changes.
-   **Syntax-aware diffs** highlight the meaningful changes in a value.
-   **Built-in test watcher:** see changes immediately with `mix mneme.watch`.

Getting started
---------------

1.  Add `:mneme` as a dependency in your `mix.exs`.
    
    defp deps do
      \[
        {:mneme, ">= 0.0.0", only: :test}
      \]
    end
    
2.  Fetch dependencies and run `mix mneme.install` with `MIX_ENV=test`. You're prompted with a diff before any files are saved.
    
    $ mix deps.get
    
    # If MIX\_ENV=test is not set, you will see a "task could not be found" error
    $ MIX\_ENV=test mix mneme.install
    
3.  Add `use Mneme` wherever you `use ExUnit.Case`.
    
    defmodule MyTest do
      use ExUnit.Case, async: true
      use Mneme
    
      test "arithmetic" do
        auto\_assert 2 + 2
      end
    end
    
4.  Run `mix test` and type `y<ENTER>` when prompted. The `auto_assert` call should be updated to:
    
    auto\_assert 4 <- 2 + 2
    

Interactive tour
----------------

If you'd like to see Mneme in action, you can download and run examples/tour\_mneme.exs, a standalone tour that only requires that you have Elixir installed. Give it a try without installing Mneme into your own project.

$ curl -o tour\_mneme.exs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zachallaun/mneme/main/examples/tour\_mneme.exs

$ elixir tour\_mneme.exs

Requirements
------------

### Elixir

Mneme requires Elixir version 1.14 or later.

### Formatter

**If you do not use a formatter, the first auto-assertion will reformat the entire file,** introducing unrelated formatting changes. Mneme rewrites your test scripts when updating an assertion using the formatter configuration for your project.

It's highly recommended to configure your editor to format Elixir files on-save.

Supported formatters:

-   `Mix.Tasks.Format` (Elixir's default formatter)
-   `FreedomFormatter`

Command line interface
----------------------

Auto-assertions are run with your normal tests when you run `mix test` and a terminal prompt is used whenever one needs to be updated. Here's what that might look like:

Whenever that happens, you have a few options:

Key

Action

Description

`y`

Accept

Accept the proposed change. The assertion will be re-run and should pass.

`n`

Reject

Reject the proposed change and fail the test.

`s`

Skip

Skip this assertion. The test will not fail, but the `mix test` process will exit with `1`.

`k`

Next

If multiple patterns have been generated, cycle to the next one.

`K`

Last

If multiple patterns have been generated, cycle to the last one.

`j`

Previous

If multiple patterns have been generated, cycle to the previous one.

`J`

First

If multiple patterns have been generated, cycle to the first one.

Note that the CLI is not available when tests are run in a CI environment.

Continuous Integration
----------------------

In a CI environment, Mneme will not attempt to prompt and update any assertions, but will instead fail any tests that would update. This behavior is enabled by the `CI` environment variable, which is set by convention by many continuous integration providers.

export CI=true
