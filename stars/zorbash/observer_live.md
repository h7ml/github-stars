ObserverLive
============

This is a port of observer\_cli using phoenix and LiveView.

⚠️ It's still a work in progress and has not been tested in production.

Demo: Try it

Roadmap
-------

This project may have started as a demo for the capabilities of LiveView, but I'm keen to port the rest of observer\_cli's ports. Any help is welcome!

If you're interested to help, submit a PR. For questions find me on elixir-lang.slack.com

Development
-----------

To run it locally:

-   Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
-   Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
-   Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
-   Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit `localhost:4000` from your browser.
