PgDog is a transaction pooler and logical replication manager that can shard PostgreSQL. Written in Rust, PgDog is fast, secure and can manage hundreds of databases and hundreds of thousands of connections.

Documentation

Quick start
-----------

### Kubernetes

Helm chart is **here**. To install it, run:

helm repo add pgdogdev https://helm.pgdog.dev
helm install pgdog pgdogdev/pgdog

### Docker

You can try PgDog quickly using Docker. Install Docker Compose and run:

```
docker-compose up
```

It will take a few minutes to build PgDog from source and launch the containers. Once started, you can connect to PgDog with psql (or any other PostgreSQL client):

```
PGPASSWORD=postgres psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6432 -U postgres gssencmode=disable
```

The demo comes with 3 shards and 2 sharded tables:

INSERT INTO users (id, email) VALUES (1, 'admin@acme.com');
INSERT INTO payments (id, user\_id, amount) VALUES (1, 1, 100.0);

SELECT \* FROM users WHERE id \= 1;
SELECT \* FROM payments WHERE user\_id \= 1;

### Monitoring

PgDog exposes both the standard PgBouncer-style admin database and an OpenMetrics endpoint. The admin database isn't 100% compatible, so we recommend you use OpenMetrics for monitoring. Example Datadog configuration and dashboard are included.

Features
--------

### Load balancer

PgDog is an application layer (OSI Level 7) load balancer for PostgreSQL. It understands the Postgres protocol, can proxy multiple replicas (and primary) and distributes transactions evenly between databases. It supports multiple strategies, like round robin, random and least active connections. PgDog can also inspect queries and send `SELECT` queries to replicas, and all others to the primary. This allows to proxy all databases behind a single PgDog deployment.

ðŸ“˜ **Load balancer**

#### Healthchecks and failover

PgDog maintains a real-time list of healthy hosts. When a database fails a healthcheck, it's removed from the active rotation and queries are re-routed to other replicas. This works like an HTTP load balancer, except it's for your database.

Failover maximizes database availability and protects against bad network connections, temporary hardware failures or misconfiguration.

ðŸ“˜ **Healthchecks**

### Transaction pooling

Like PgBouncer, PgDog supports transaction (and session) pooling, allowing 100,000s of clients to use just a few PostgreSQL server connections.

ðŸ“˜ **Transactions**

### Sharding

PgDog is able to handle databases with multiple shards by routing queries automatically to one or more shards. Using the native PostgreSQL parser, PgDog understands queries, extracts sharding keys and determines the best routing strategy. For cross-shard queries, PgDog assembles and transforms results in memory, sending them all to the client as if they are coming from a single database.

ðŸ“˜ **Sharding**

#### Using `COPY`

PgDog ships with a text/CSV parser and can split `COPY` commands between all shards automatically. This allows clients to ingest data into sharded PostgreSQL without preprocessing.

ðŸ“˜ **Copy**

#### Re-sharding

PgDog understands the PostgreSQL logical replication protocol and can split data between databases in the background and without downtime. This allows to shard existing databases and add more shards to existing clusters in production, without impacting database operations.

ðŸ“˜ **Re-sharding**

### Configuration

PgDog is highly configurable and most aspects of its operation can be tweaked at runtime, without having to restart the process or break connections. If you've used PgBouncer (or PgCat) before, the options will be familiar. If not, they are documented with examples.

ðŸ“˜ **Configuration**

Running PgDog locally
---------------------

Install the latest version of the Rust compiler from rust-lang.org. Clone this repository and build the project in release mode:

cargo build --release

It's important to use the release profile if you're deploying to production or want to run performance benchmarks.

### Configuration

PgDog has two configuration files:

-   `pgdog.toml` which contains general settings and PostgreSQL servers information
-   `users.toml` for users and passwords

Most options have reasonable defaults, so a basic configuration for a single user and database running on the same machine is pretty short:

**`pgdog.toml`**

\[\[databases\]\]
name = "pgdog"
host = "127.0.0.1"

**`users.toml`**

\[\[users\]\]
name = "pgdog"
password = "pgdog"
database = "pgdog"

If you'd like to try this out, you can set it up like so:

```
CREATE DATABASE pgdog;
CREATE USER pgdog PASSWORD 'pgdog' LOGIN;
```

#### Try sharding

Sharded database clusters are set in the config. For example, to set up a 2 shard cluster, you can:

**`pgdog.toml`**

\[\[databases\]\]
name = "pgdog\_sharded"
host = "127.0.0.1"
database\_name = "shard\_0"
shard = 0

\[\[databases\]\]
name = "pgdog\_sharded"
host = "127.0.0.1"
database\_name = "shard\_1"
shard = 1

Don't forget to specify a user:

**`users.toml`**

\[\[users\]\]
database = "pgdog\_sharded"
name = "pgdog"
password = "pgdog"

And finally, to make it work locally, create the required databases:

```
CREATE DATABASE shard_0;
CREATE DATABASE shard_1;

GRANT ALL ON DATABASE shard_0 TO pgdog;
GRANT ALL ON DATABASE shard_1 TO pgdog;
```

### Start PgDog

Running PgDog can be done with Cargo:

cargo run --release

#### Command-line options

PgDog supports several command-line options:

-   `-c, --config <CONFIG>`: Path to the configuration file (default: `"pgdog.toml"`)
-   `-u, --users <USERS>`: Path to the users.toml file (default: `"users.toml"`)
-   `-d, --database_url <DATABASE_URL>`: Connection URL(s). Can be specified multiple times to add multiple database connections. When provided, these URLs override database configurations from the config file.

Example using database URLs directly:

cargo run --release -- -d postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/db1 -d postgres://user:pass@localhost:5433/db2

You can connect to PgDog with `psql` or any other PostgreSQL client:

psql "postgres://pgdog:pgdog@127.0.0.1:6432/pgdog?gssencmode=disable"

ðŸš¦ Status ðŸš¦
------------

PgDog is used in production and at scale. Most features are stable, while some are experimental. Check documentation for more details.

Performance
-----------

PgDog does its best to minimize its impact on overall database performance. Using Rust and Tokio is a great start for a fast network proxy, but additional care is also taken to perform as few operations as possible while moving data between client and server sockets. Some benchmarks are provided to help set a baseline.

License
-------

PgDog is free and open source software, licensed under the AGPL v3. While often misunderstood, this license is very permissive and allows the following without any additional requirements from you or your organization:

-   Internal use
-   Private modifications for internal use without sharing any source code

You can freely use PgDog to power your PostgreSQL databases without having to share any source code, including proprietary work product or any PgDog modifications you make.

AGPL was written specifically for organizations that offer PgDog _as a public service_ (e.g. database cloud providers) and require those organizations to share any modifications they make to PgDog, including new features and bug fixes.
