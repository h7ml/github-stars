Face Recognition
================

_You can also read a translated version of this file in Chinese 简体中文版 or in Korean 한국어 or in Japanese 日本語._

Recognize and manipulate faces from Python or from the command line with the world's simplest face recognition library.

Built using dlib's state-of-the-art face recognition built with deep learning. The model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark.

This also provides a simple `face_recognition` command line tool that lets you do face recognition on a folder of images from the command line!

Features
--------

#### Find faces in pictures

Find all the faces that appear in a picture:

import face\_recognition
image \= face\_recognition.load\_image\_file("your\_file.jpg")
face\_locations \= face\_recognition.face\_locations(image)

#### Find and manipulate facial features in pictures

Get the locations and outlines of each person's eyes, nose, mouth and chin.

import face\_recognition
image \= face\_recognition.load\_image\_file("your\_file.jpg")
face\_landmarks\_list \= face\_recognition.face\_landmarks(image)

Finding facial features is super useful for lots of important stuff. But you can also use it for really stupid stuff like applying digital make-up (think 'Meitu'):

#### Identify faces in pictures

Recognize who appears in each photo.

import face\_recognition
known\_image \= face\_recognition.load\_image\_file("biden.jpg")
unknown\_image \= face\_recognition.load\_image\_file("unknown.jpg")

biden\_encoding \= face\_recognition.face\_encodings(known\_image)\[0\]
unknown\_encoding \= face\_recognition.face\_encodings(unknown\_image)\[0\]

results \= face\_recognition.compare\_faces(\[biden\_encoding\], unknown\_encoding)

You can even use this library with other Python libraries to do real-time face recognition:

See this example for the code.

Usage
-----

### Command-Line Interface

When you install `face_recognition`, you get two simple command-line programs:

-   `face_recognition` - Recognize faces in a photograph or folder full for photographs.
-   `face_detection` - Find faces in a photograph or folder full for photographs.

#### `face_recognition` command line tool

The `face_recognition` command lets you recognize faces in a photograph or folder full for photographs.

First, you need to provide a folder with one picture of each person you already know. There should be one image file for each person with the files named according to who is in the picture:

Next, you need a second folder with the files you want to identify:

Then in you simply run the command `face_recognition`, passing in the folder of known people and the folder (or single image) with unknown people and it tells you who is in each image:

$ face\_recognition ./pictures\_of\_people\_i\_know/ ./unknown\_pictures/

/unknown\_pictures/unknown.jpg,Barack Obama
/face\_recognition\_test/unknown\_pictures/unknown.jpg,unknown\_person

There's one line in the output for each face. The data is comma-separated with the filename and the name of the person found.

An `unknown_person` is a face in the image that didn't match anyone in your folder of known people.

#### `face_detection` command line tool

The `face_detection` command lets you find the location (pixel coordinatates) of any faces in an image.

Just run the command `face_detection`, passing in a folder of images to check (or a single image):

$ face\_detection  ./folder\_with\_pictures/

examples/image1.jpg,65,215,169,112
examples/image2.jpg,62,394,211,244
examples/image2.jpg,95,941,244,792

It prints one line for each face that was detected. The coordinates reported are the top, right, bottom and left coordinates of the face (in pixels).

##### Adjusting Tolerance / Sensitivity

If you are getting multiple matches for the same person, it might be that the people in your photos look very similar and a lower tolerance value is needed to make face comparisons more strict.

You can do that with the `--tolerance` parameter. The default tolerance value is 0.6 and lower numbers make face comparisons more strict:

$ face\_recognition --tolerance 0.54 ./pictures\_of\_people\_i\_know/ ./unknown\_pictures/

/unknown\_pictures/unknown.jpg,Barack Obama
/face\_recognition\_test/unknown\_pictures/unknown.jpg,unknown\_person

If you want to see the face distance calculated for each match in order to adjust the tolerance setting, you can use `--show-distance true`:

$ face\_recognition --show-distance true ./pictures\_of\_people\_i\_know/ ./unknown\_pictures/

/unknown\_pictures/unknown.jpg,Barack Obama,0.378542298956785
/face\_recognition\_test/unknown\_pictures/unknown.jpg,unknown\_person,None

##### More Examples

If you simply want to know the names of the people in each photograph but don't care about file names, you could do this:

$ face\_recognition ./pictures\_of\_people\_i\_know/ ./unknown\_pictures/ | cut -d ',' -f2

Barack Obama
unknown\_person

##### Speeding up Face Recognition

Face recognition can be done in parallel if you have a computer with multiple CPU cores. For example, if your system has 4 CPU cores, you can process about 4 times as many images in the same amount of time by using all your CPU cores in parallel.

If you are using Python 3.4 or newer, pass in a `--cpus <number_of_cpu_cores_to_use>` parameter:

$ face\_recognition --cpus 4 ./pictures\_of\_people\_i\_know/ ./unknown\_pictures/

You can also pass in `--cpus -1` to use all CPU cores in your system.

#### Python Module

You can import the `face_recognition` module and then easily manipulate faces with just a couple of lines of code. It's super easy!

API Docs: https://face-recognition.readthedocs.io.

##### Automatically find all the faces in an image

import face\_recognition

image \= face\_recognition.load\_image\_file("my\_picture.jpg")
face\_locations \= face\_recognition.face\_locations(image)

\# face\_locations is now an array listing the co-ordinates of each face!

See this example to try it out.

You can also opt-in to a somewhat more accurate deep-learning-based face detection model.

Note: GPU acceleration (via NVidia's CUDA library) is required for good performance with this model. You'll also want to enable CUDA support when compliling `dlib`.

import face\_recognition

image \= face\_recognition.load\_image\_file("my\_picture.jpg")
face\_locations \= face\_recognition.face\_locations(image, model\="cnn")

\# face\_locations is now an array listing the co-ordinates of each face!

See this example to try it out.

If you have a lot of images and a GPU, you can also find faces in batches.

##### Automatically locate the facial features of a person in an image

import face\_recognition

image \= face\_recognition.load\_image\_file("my\_picture.jpg")
face\_landmarks\_list \= face\_recognition.face\_landmarks(image)

\# face\_landmarks\_list is now an array with the locations of each facial feature in each face.
\# face\_landmarks\_list\[0\]\['left\_eye'\] would be the location and outline of the first person's left eye.

See this example to try it out.

##### Recognize faces in images and identify who they are

import face\_recognition

picture\_of\_me \= face\_recognition.load\_image\_file("me.jpg")
my\_face\_encoding \= face\_recognition.face\_encodings(picture\_of\_me)\[0\]

\# my\_face\_encoding now contains a universal 'encoding' of my facial features that can be compared to any other picture of a face!

unknown\_picture \= face\_recognition.load\_image\_file("unknown.jpg")
unknown\_face\_encoding \= face\_recognition.face\_encodings(unknown\_picture)\[0\]

\# Now we can see the two face encodings are of the same person with \`compare\_faces\`!

results \= face\_recognition.compare\_faces(\[my\_face\_encoding\], unknown\_face\_encoding)

if results\[0\] \== True:
    print("It's a picture of me!")
else:
    print("It's not a picture of me!")

See this example to try it out.

If you want to learn how face location and recognition work instead of depending on a black box library, read my article.

Caveats
-------

-   The face recognition model is trained on adults and does not work very well on children. It tends to mix up children quite easy using the default comparison threshold of 0.6.
-   Accuracy may vary between ethnic groups. Please see this wiki page for more details.

Deployment to Cloud Hosts (Heroku, AWS, etc)
--------------------------------------------

Since `face_recognition` depends on `dlib` which is written in C++, it can be tricky to deploy an app using it to a cloud hosting provider like Heroku or AWS.

To make things easier, there's an example Dockerfile in this repo that shows how to run an app built with `face_recognition` in a Docker container. With that, you should be able to deploy to any service that supports Docker images.

You can try the Docker image locally by running: `docker-compose up --build`

There are also several prebuilt Docker images.

Linux users with a GPU (drivers >= 384.81) and Nvidia-Docker installed can run the example on the GPU: Open the docker-compose.yml file and uncomment the `dockerfile: Dockerfile.gpu` and `runtime: nvidia` lines.
