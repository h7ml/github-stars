Plants vs Zombies Travel — A Fan-Made PvZ Game!
===============================================

What's PvZ Travel?
------------------

Plants vs Zombies Travel ("《植物大战僵尸：旅行》" in Chinese) is a fan-made PvZ Game, written in JavaScript, which is developed by JiangNanGame("江南游戏开发社" in Chinese), a non-profit student organization in China.

We have developed this game since early 2016 and it still isn't completely finished now. In order to make more people learn about our masterwork, today we decide to publish some source code of PvZ Travel on GitHub and some other websites. The repository is named _The Open Source Version Of PvZ Travel_.

The method to build the source code of PvZ Travel.
--------------------------------------------------

_The Open Source Version Of PvZ Travel_ don't need any tool to built its source code. What you only need to do is opening the file `index.html` by the lastest version of Google Chrome and then you can run the game program.

Of course, you can also upload the game to your web server to share it with others.

Why some source code was encrypted?
-----------------------------------

In order to protect our rights and interests, it's obvious that we couldn't publish all the source code of _PvZ Travel_ under present conditions. However, we sincerely hope that this open source version can help you learn more about _PvZ Travel_.

What's more, for the same reason, when we update _PvZ Travel_, we will not publish the source code of its lastest version to this repository soon. Maybe we will update _The Open Source Version Of PvZ Travel_ semiannually. However, We can change our mind at any time if it is necessary.
