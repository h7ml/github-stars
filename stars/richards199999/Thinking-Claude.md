Thinking Claude
===============

Let Claude think comprehensively before responding!

> **A super quick reminder:** Thinking claude **is not aimed for benchmarks or huge leaps in math or something**, since those are pre-determined by the base model (new Claude-3.5 Sonnet). I only want to explore how further we could reach with Claude's "deep mindset". That said, when using it in your daily tasks, you will find Claude's inner monolog (thinking process) very very fun and interesting.

Demo

> It is supposed to work on both `Free` and `Pro` versions of Claude Web App with `Claude 3.5 Sonnet` model.

Here is a demo of using the latest Thinking Cluade Chrome extension (click to download v3.2.3 ) installed in Chrome with the chat of Claude (check Browser Extension for more) featured with an instruction selector:

Overview
--------

This project consists of two main components:

1.  **Thinking Protocol**: A comprehensive set of instructions that guides Claude to think deeply and systematically before responding
2.  **Browser Extension**: A tool that makes Claude's thinking process more readable and manageable in the browser interface
