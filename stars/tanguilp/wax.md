Wax
===

WebAuthn library for elixir

Goal: implement a _comprehensive_ FIDO2 library on the server side (_Relying party_ or RP in the WebAuthn terminology) to authenticate users with WebAuthn.

For semantics (FIDO2, WebAuthn, FIDO...), read this article

Demo app
--------

You can try out and study WebAuthn authentication with Wax thanks to the wax\_demo test application.

See also a video demonstration of an authentication flow which allows replacing the password authentication scheme by a WebAuthn password-less authentication:

Project status
--------------

-   Support the FIDO2 standard (especially all types of attestation statement formats and all mandatory algorithms). See the "Support of FIDO2" section for further information
-   **Passes all the 170 tests** of the official test suite (tested using WaxFidoTestSuiteServer)
-   This library has **not** be reviewed by independent security / FIDO2 specialists - use it at your own risks or blindly trust its author!
-   This library does not come with a javascript library to handle WebAuthn calls

Compatibility
-------------

OTP25+

Installation
------------

Add the following line to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

def deps do
  \[
    {:wax\_, "~> 0.6.0"}
  \]
end

Note that due to a name collision, the application name is `:wax_`, and not `:wax`. It doesn't cause issues using both library because the other's package doesn't use the atom `Wax` as the base module name.

Documentation

Usage
-----

To use FIDO2 for authentication, you must first _register_ a new FIDO2 key for a user. The process is therefore the following:

1.  Register a FIDO2 key for a user
2.  Authenticate as much as you want the user using the FIDO2 key registered in step 1

Optionaly, you might want to store more than one key, for instance if the user have several authenticators.

The Wax library doesn't provide with a user data store to store the key generated in step 1 and to retrieve it in step 2. Instead, it lets you use any data store. The data to be stored is described in the `Wax` module's documentation.

### Registration

Wax provides with 2 functions for registration:

1.  `Wax.new_registration_challenge/1`: generates a challenge that must subsequently be sent to the client for use by the javascript WebAuthn API
2.  `Wax.register/3`: takes into parameter the response of the WebAuthn javascript API and the challenge generated in step 1, and verifies it

Since the challenge generated in step 1 must be passed as a parameter in step 2, it is required to persist it on the server side, for instance in the session:

\# generating a challenge

challenge \= Wax.new\_registration\_challenge()

conn
|> put\_session(:challenge, challenge)
|> render(register\_key\_page, challenge: challenge.bytes)
\# the challenge is to be sent on the client one way or another
\# this can be direct within the HTML, or using an API call

to be then retrieved when verifying the assertion:

challenge \= get\_session(conn, :challenge)

case Wax.register(attestation\_object, client\_data\_json, challenge) do
	{:ok, {authenticator\_data, attestation\_result}} \->
		\# success case

	{:error, e} \-\>
		\# verification failure
end

In the success case, a server will save the credential id (generated by the WebAuthn javascript call) and the cose key in its user database for use for authentication.

Authenticator data contains the COSE key generated by the authenticator, which can be found in `authenticator_data.attested_credential_data.credential_public_key`:

%{
  \-3 \=> <<182, 81, 183, 218, 92, 107, 106, 120, 60, 51, 75, 104, 141, 130,
    119, 232, 34, 245, 84, 203, 246, 165, 148, 179, 169, 31, 205, 126, 241,
    188, 241, 176\>>,
  \-2 \=> <<89, 29, 193, 225, 4, 234, 101, 162, 32, 6, 15, 14, 130, 179, 223,
    207, 53, 2, 134, 184, 178, 127, 51, 145, 57, 180, 104, 242, 138, 96, 27,
    221\>>,
  \-1 \=> 1,
  1 \=> 2,
  3 \=> \-7
}

It probably doesn't need to be searchable or indexed, which is why one can store as a binary. To convert back and forth Elixir data structures to binary and store the keys in a database (SQL, for instance), take a look at the Erlang functions `:erlang.term_to_binary/1` and `:erlang.binary_to_term/1`.

For further information, refer to the `Wax` module documentation.

### Authentication

The process is quite similar, with 2 functions for authentication:

1.  `Wax.new_authentication_challenge/1`: generates a challenge from a list of `{credential id, key}` saved during the registration processes. It also has to be sent to the client for use by the javascript WebAuthn API
2.  `Wax.authenticate/5`: to be called to verify the WebAuthn javascript API response with the returned data (composed of signature, authenticator data, etc.) with the challenge generated in step 1

This also requires storing the challenge:

cred\_ids\_and\_keys \= UserStore.get\_keys(username)

challenge \= Wax.new\_authentication\_challenge(allow\_credentials: cred\_ids\_and\_keys)

conn
|> put\_session(:authentication\_challenge, challenge)
|> render(auth\_verify\_page, challenge: challenge.bytes, creds: cred\_ids\_and\_keys)
\# the challenge is to be sent on the client one way or another
\# this can be direct within the HTML, or using an API call

to be passed as a paramter to the `Wax.authenticate/5` function:

challenge \= get\_session(conn, :authentication\_challenge)

case Wax.authenticate(raw\_id, authenticator\_data, sig, client\_data\_json, challenge) do
	{:ok, \_} \->
		\# ok, user authenticated

	{:error, \_} \-\>
		\# invalid WebAuthn response
end

For further information, refer to the `Wax` module documentation.

Options
-------

The options are set when generating the challenge (for both registration and authentication). Options can be configured either globally in the configuration file or when generating the challenge. Some also have default values.

Option values set during challenge generation take precedence over globally configured options, which takes precedence over default values.

These options are:

Option

Type

Applies to

Default value

Notes

`attestation`

`"none"` or `"direct"`

registration

`"none"`

`origin`

`String.t()`

registration & authentication

**Mandatory**. Example: `https://www.example.com`

`rp_id`

`String.t()` or `:auto`

registration & authentication

If set to `:auto`, automatically determined from the `origin` (set to the host)

With `:auto`, it defaults to the full host (e.g.: `www.example.com`). This option allow you to set the `rp_id` to another valid value (e.g.: `example.com`)

`user_verification`

`"discouraged"`, `"preferred"` or `"required"`

registration & authentication

`"preferred"`

`trusted_attestation_types`

`[t:Wax.Attestation.type/0]`

registration

`[:none, :basic, :uncertain, :attca, :anonca, :self]`

`verify_trust_root`

`boolean()`

registration

`true`

Only for `u2f` and `packed` attestation. `tpm` attestation format is always checked against metadata

`acceptable_authenticator_statuses`

`[String.t()]`

registration

`["FIDO_CERTIFIED", "FIDO_CERTIFIED_L1", "FIDO_CERTIFIED_L1plus", "FIDO_CERTIFIED_L2", "FIDO_CERTIFIED_L2plus", "FIDO_CERTIFIED_L3", "FIDO_CERTIFIED_L3plus"]`

The `"UPDATE_AVAILABLE"` status is not whitelisted by default

`timeout`

`non_neg_integer()`

registration & authentication

`20 * 60`

The validity duration of a challenge, in seconds

`android_key_allow_software_enforcement`

`boolean()`

registration

`false`

When registration is a Android key, determines whether software enforcement is acceptable (`true`) or only hardware enforcement is (`false`)

`silent_authentication_enabled`

`boolean()`

authentication

`false`

See fido-alliance/conformance-test-tools-resources#434

`bytes`

`binary()`

registration & authentication

random bytes

Allows to provide with your own challenge. This is **not** recommended unless you know what you're doing. Refer to the Security considerations for more information

FIDO2 Metadata
--------------

If you use attestation, you need to enabled metadata.

### Configuring MDSv3 metadata

This is the official metadata service of the FIDO foundation.

Set the `:update_metadata` environment variable to `true` and metadata will load automatically through HTTP from https://mds3.fidoalliance.org/.

### Loading FIDO2 metadata from a directory

In addition to the FIDO2 metadata service, it is possible to load metadata from a directory. To do so, the `:metadata_dir` application environment variable must be set to one of:

-   a `String.t()`: the path to the directory containing the metadata files
-   an `atom()`: in this case, the files are loaded from the `"fido2_metadata"` directory of the private (`"priv/"`) directory of the application (whose name is the atom)

In both case, Wax tries to load all files (even directories and other special files).

#### Example configuration

config :wax\_,
  origin: "http://localhost:4000",
  rp\_id: :auto,
  metadata\_dir: :my\_application

will try to load all files of the `"priv/fido2_metadata/"` of the `:my_application` as FIDO2 metadata statements. On failure, a warning is emitted.

Security considerations
-----------------------

-   Make sure to understand the implications of not using attested credentials before accepting `none` or `self` attestation types, or disabling it for `packed` and `u2f` formats by disabling it with the `verify_trust_root` option
-   This library has **not** be reviewed by independent security / FIDO2 specialists - use it at your own risks or blindly trust its author! If you're knowledgeable about FIDO2 and willing to help reviewing it, please contact the author
-   When providing your own challenge, please make sure to understand that:
    -   it explicitly violates the recommandation in the standard
    -   it exposes you to some attacks (such as replay attacks)
    -   you have no guarantee that the user understood what he has been signing (no specific browser UI was presented)
