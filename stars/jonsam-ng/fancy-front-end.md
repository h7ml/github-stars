🏠 Introduce
------------

Since graduating, I've been constantly thinking about how to refine my JavaScript skills and broaden my horizon of front-end knowledge. After that, I confirmed that **reading source code is the best way to get ahead quickly**, so I spent a year continuously pushing the process of reading code.

From laying out a plan, to figuring out the skills of taking notes, to overcoming difficulties in reading code of some great frameworks, I learned a lot and was able to sink my teeth into it as I continued to challenge and explore 💯. `Fancy Front End` is one such site, which is all about source code and the better progress of front-end developers.
