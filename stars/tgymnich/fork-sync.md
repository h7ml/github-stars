Fork Sync
=========

Github action to sync your Forks. This action uses octokit and the GitHub API to automatically create and merge a pull request with the head defined by `head` into the base defined by `base`. The head branch owner is defined by `owner`. If you create a PR in the same repository you can omit the `owner` parameter.

Example Workflow
================

name: Sync Fork

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '\*/30 \* \* \* \*' # every 30 minutes
  workflow\_dispatch: # on button click

jobs:
  sync:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: tgymnich/fork-sync@v1.8
        with:
          owner: llvm
          base: master
          head: master

Auto approve
------------

If you use a workflow which does not allow to merge pull requests without a review ("Require pull request reviews before merging" in your repo settings) you can set `auto_approve` to `true`. In that case you'll have to provide a personal access token for a user which is allowed to review the pull requests changes. Make sure the token has at least `public_repo` permissions and store the token inside of the repository secrets.

An example workflow would then look like this:

name: Sync Fork

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '\*/30 \* \* \* \*' # every 30 minutes
  workflow\_dispatch: # on button click

jobs:
  sync:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: tgymnich/fork-sync@v2.0
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL\_TOKEN }}
          owner: llvm
          base: master
          head: master
