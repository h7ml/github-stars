Update 2022/7/13: NUWA-Infinity
-------------------------------

\[Project page\] \[Paper\]

NUWA-Infinity is a generative model for infinite visual synthesis, which is defined as the task of generating arbitrarily-sized high-resolution images or long-duration videos.

Update 2021/11/26: NÜWA
-----------------------

NÜWA is a unified multimodal pre-trained model that can **generate new** or **manipulate existing** visual data (i.e., **images and videos**) for **8** visual synthesis tasks (as shown above).
