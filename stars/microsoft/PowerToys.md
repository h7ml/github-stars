‚ú® What's new
------------

**Version 0.94 (September 2025)**

For an in-depth look at the latest changes, visit the Windows Command Line blog.

**‚ú® Highlights**

-   PowerToys Settings added a Settings search with fuzzy matching, suggestions, a results page, and UX polish to make finding options faster.
-   A comprehensive hotkey conflict detection system was introduced in Settings to surface and help resolve conflicting shortcuts. Note that the default hotkey settings (Win+Ctrl+Shift+T, Win+Ctrl+V, Win+Ctrl+T, Win+Shift+T) may overlap with existing Windows system shortcuts. This is expected. You can resolve the conflict by assigning different hotkeys.
-   Mouse Utilities added a ‚ÄúGliding cursor‚Äù accessibility feature to Mouse Pointer Crosshairs for single‚Äëbutton cursor movement and clicking. Thanks @mikehall-ms!
-   The installer was upgraded to WiX 5 after WiX 3 reached end-of-life; this move improved installer security, reliability, and community support.
-   Tons of bug fixes and improvements for Command Palette, including visual updates and new support for filters on ListPages (handy for extension developers).
-   Hosts Editor now has a ‚ÄúNo leading spaces‚Äù option so active host entries can start at column 0 even if others are disabled. Thanks @mohammed-saalim!
-   Context menu registration was moved from the installer to runtime to avoid loading disabled modules (runtime registrations).
-   Quick Accent now supports Maltese, and frequently used accents appear first (and are remembered across sessions). Thanks @rovercoder! @davidegiacometti!

### Always On Top

-   Fixed the border hover cursor so it shows the arrow instead of the wait cursor. Thanks @davidegiacometti!

### Command Palette

-   Applied single-click activation only to pointer input; keyboard always activates immediately. Thanks @jiripolasek!
-   Let context menus open at the cursor by removing window-bound constraints. Thanks @jiripolasek!
-   Made error messages clearer with timestamps, HRESULTs, and full details for easier diagnosis. Thanks @jiripolasek!
-   Prevented crashes and improved robustness when updating providers without commands. Thanks @jiripolasek!
-   Ensured the Settings window reliably comes to the front when opened. Thanks @jiripolasek!
-   Replaced the Clipboard History icon with a colorful Fluent icon. Thanks @jiripolasek!
-   Hardened ContentIcon to avoid duplicate parenting and improve diagnostics. Thanks @jiripolasek!
-   Standardized null checks using C# pattern matching for safer behavior.

-   Added single-select filters to DynamicListPage and updated Windows Services sample.

-   Sorted DateTime extension results by relevance for better usability.
-   Reduced search text "jiggling" by avoiding redundant change notifications.
-   Centralized automation notifications in a UIHelper for better accessibility. Thanks @chatasweetie!
-   Preserved Adaptive Card action types during trimming via DynamicDependency.
-   Added an acrylic backdrop and refined styling to the context menu. Thanks @jiripolasek!
-   Prevented disposed pages and Settings windows from handling stale messages. Thanks @jiripolasek!
-   Made the extension API easier to evolve without breaking clients.
-   Added "evil" sample pages to help reproduce tricky bugs.
-   Fixed WinGet trim-safety issues by replacing LINQ with manual iteration.
-   Cancelled stale list fetches to avoid older results overwriting newer ones in CmdPal.

### Command Palette extensions

-   Improved empty states and ranking logic for multiple extensions. Thanks @htcfreek!
-   Added app icons to the All Apps "Run" context command when available.
-   Restored missing builtin icons by standardizing extension dependencies.
-   Unblocked local deployment by adding WinAppSDK to two sample extensions.

### Hosts File Editor

### Image Resizer

-   Fixed Image Resizer localization by installing satellite resources under the WinUI 3 apps culture path.

### Mouse Utilities

-   Introduced "Gliding cursor" to control the pointer and click with a single hotkey for better accessibility. Thanks @mikehall-ms!

-   Introduced Settings search with fuzzy matching and navigation to specific controls.
