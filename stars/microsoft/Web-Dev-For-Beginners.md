üå± Getting Started
------------------

> **Teachers**, we have included some suggestions on how to use this curriculum. We'd love your feedback in our discussion forum!

**Learners**, for each lesson, start with a pre-lecture quiz and follow through with reading the lecture material, completing the various activities and check your understanding with the post-lecture quiz.

To enhance your learning experience, connect with your peers to work on the projects together! Discussions are encouraged in our discussion forum where our team of moderators will be available to answer your questions.

To further your education, we highly recommend exploring Microsoft Learn for additional study materials.

### üìã Setting up your environment

This curriculum has a development environment ready to go! As you get started you can choose to run the curriculum in a Codespace (_a browser-based, no installs needed environment_), or locally on your computer using a text editor such as Visual Studio Code.

#### Create your repository

For you to easily save your work, it is recommended that you create your own copy of this repository. You can do this by clicking the **Use this template** button at the top of the page. This will create a new repository in your GitHub account with a copy of the curriculum.

Follow these steps:

1.  **Fork the Repository**: Click on the "Fork" button at the top-right corner of this page.
2.  **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/microsoft/Web-Dev-For-Beginners.git`

#### Running the curriculum in a Codespace

In your copy of this repository that you created, click the **Code** button and select **Open with Codespaces**. This will create a new Codespace for you to work in.

!Codespace./images/createcodespace.png)

#### Running the curriculum locally on your computer

To run this curriculum locally on your computer, you will need a text editor, a browser and a command line tool. Our first lesson, Introduction to Programming Languages and Tools of the Trade, will walk you through various options for each of these tools for you to select what works best for you.

Our recommendation is to use Visual Studio Code as your editor, which also has a built-in Terminal. You can download Visual Studio Code here.

1.  Clone your repository to your computer. You can do this by clicking the **Code** button and copying the URL:
    
    !CodeSpace
    
    Then, open Terminal within Visual Studio Code and run the following command, replacing `<your-repository-url>` with the URL you just copied:
    
    git clone <your-repository-url\>
    
2.  Open the folder in Visual Studio Code. You can do this by clicking **File** > **Open Folder** and selecting the folder you just cloned.
    

> Recommended Visual Studio Code extensions:
> 
> -   Live Server - to preview HTML pages within Visual Studio Code
> -   Copilot - to help you write code faster

üìÇ Each lesson includes:
------------------------

-   optional sketchnote
-   optional supplemental video
-   pre-lesson warmup quiz
-   written lesson
-   for project-based lessons, step-by-step guides on how to build the project
-   knowledge checks
-   a challenge
-   supplemental reading

üè´ Pedagogy
-----------

Our curriculum is designed with two key pedagogical principles in mind:

-   project-based learning
-   frequent quizzes

The program teaches the fundamentals of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, as well as the latest tools and techniques used by today's web developers. Students will have the opportunity to develop hands-on experience by building a typing game, virtual terrarium, eco-friendly browser extension, space-invader-style game, and a banking app for businesses. By the end of the series, students will have gained a solid understanding of web development.

> üéì You can take the first few lessons in this curriculum as a Learn Path on Microsoft Learn!

By ensuring that the content aligns with projects, the process is made more engaging for students and retention of concepts will be augmented. We also wrote several starter lessons in JavaScript basics to introduce concepts, paired with a video from the "Beginners Series to: JavaScript" collection of video tutorials, some of whose authors contributed to this curriculum.

In addition, a low-stakes quiz before a class sets the intention of the student towards learning a topic, while a second quiz after class ensures further retention. This curriculum was designed to be flexible and fun and can be taken in whole or in part. The projects start small and become increasingly complex by the end of the 12-week cycle.

While we have purposefully avoided introducing JavaScript frameworks to concentrate on the basic skills needed as a web developer before adopting a framework, a good next step to completing this curriculum would be learning about Node.js via another collection of videos: "Beginner Series to: Node.js".
