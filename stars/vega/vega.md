Vega: A Visualization Grammar
=============================

**Vega** is a _visualization grammar_, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. With Vega you can describe data visualizations in a JSON format, and generate interactive views using either HTML5 Canvas or SVG.

For documentation, tutorials, and examples, see the Vega website. For a description of changes between Vega 2 and later versions, please refer to the Vega Porting Guide.

Build Instructions
------------------

For a basic setup allowing you to build Vega and run examples:

-   Clone `https://github.com/vega/vega`.
-   Run `yarn` to install dependencies for all packages. If you don't have yarn installed, see https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install. We use Yarn workspaces to manage multiple packages within this monorepo.
-   Once installation is complete, run `yarn test` to run test cases, or run `yarn build` to build output files for all packages.
-   After running either `yarn test` or `yarn build`, run `yarn serve` to launch a local web server â€” your default browser will open and you can browse to the `"test"` folder to view test specifications.

This repository includes the Vega website and documentation in the `docs` folder. To launch the website locally, first run `bundle install` in the `docs` folder to install the necessary Jekyll libraries. Afterwards, use `yarn docs` to build the documentation and launch a local webserver. After launching, you can open `http://127.0.0.1:4000/vega/` to see the website.

Internet Explorer Support
-------------------------

For backwards compatibility, Vega includes a babel-ified IE-compatible version of the code in the `packages/vega/build-es5` directory. Older browser would also require several polyfill libraries:

<script src\="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-polyfill/7.4.4/polyfill.min.js"\></script\>
<script src\="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/regenerator-runtime@0.13.3/runtime.min.js"\></script\>
<script src\="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/whatwg-fetch@3.0.0/dist/fetch.umd.min.js"\></script\>
