Vega: A Visualization Grammar
=============================

**Vega** is a _visualization grammar_, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. With Vega you can describe data visualizations in a JSON format, and generate interactive views using HTML5 Canvas or SVG.

For documentation, tutorials, and examples, see the Vega website. For a description of changes between Vega 2 and later versions, please refer to the Vega Porting Guide.

Try using Vega in the online Vega Editor.

Internet Explorer Support
-------------------------

For backwards compatibility, Vega includes a babel-ified IE-compatible version of the code in the `packages/vega/build-es5` directory. Older browsers also require these polyfill libraries:

<script src\="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-polyfill/7.4.4/polyfill.min.js"\></script\>
<script src\="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/regenerator-runtime@0.13.3/runtime.min.js"\></script\>
<script src\="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/whatwg-fetch@3.0.0/dist/fetch.umd.min.js"\></script\>
