🦜️🔗 LangChain.js
==================

LangChain is a framework for building LLM-powered applications. It helps you chain together interoperable components and third-party integrations to simplify AI application development — all while future-proofing decisions as the underlying technology evolves.

**Documentation**: To learn more about LangChain, check out the docs.

If you're looking for more advanced customization or agent orchestration, check out LangGraph.js. our framework for building agents and controllable workflows.

Note

Looking for the Python version? Check out LangChain.

To help you ship LangChain apps to production faster, check out LangSmith. LangSmith is a unified developer platform for building, testing, and monitoring LLM applications.

⚡️ Quick Install
----------------

You can use npm, pnpm, or yarn to install LangChain.js

`npm install -S langchain` or `pnpm install langchain` or `yarn add langchain`

🚀 Why use LangChain?
---------------------

LangChain helps developers build applications powered by LLMs through a standard interface for agents, models, embeddings, vector stores, and more.

Use LangChain for:

-   **Real-time data augmentation**. Easily connect LLMs to diverse data sources and external/internal systems, drawing from LangChain’s vast library of integrations with model providers, tools, vector stores, retrievers, and more.
-   **Model interoperability**. Swap models in and out as your engineering team experiments to find the best choice for your application’s needs. As the industry frontier evolves, adapt quickly — LangChain’s abstractions keep you moving without losing momentum.

📦 LangChain's ecosystem
------------------------

-   LangSmith - Unified developer platform for building, testing, and monitoring LLM applications. With LangSmith, you can debug poor-performing LLM app runs, evaluate agent trajectories, gain visibility in production, and deploy agents with confidence.
-   LangGraph - Build agents that can reliably handle complex tasks with LangGraph, our low-level agent orchestration framework. LangGraph offers customizable architecture, long-term memory, and human-in-the-loop workflows — and is trusted in production by companies like LinkedIn, Uber, Klarna, and GitLab.
