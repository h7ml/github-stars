Note

Looking for the JS/TS library? Check out LangChain.js.

LangChain is a framework for building LLM-powered applications. It helps you chain together interoperable components and third-party integrations to simplify AI application development â€” all while future-proofing decisions as the underlying technology evolves.

pip install -U langchain

To learn more about LangChain, check out the docs. If youâ€™re looking for more advanced customization or agent orchestration, check out LangGraph, our framework for building controllable agent workflows.

Why use LangChain?
------------------

LangChain helps developers build applications powered by LLMs through a standard interface for models, embeddings, vector stores, and more.

Use LangChain for:

-   **Real-time data augmentation**. Easily connect LLMs to diverse data sources and external / internal systems, drawing from LangChainâ€™s vast library of integrations with model providers, tools, vector stores, retrievers, and more.
-   **Model interoperability**. Swap models in and out as your engineering team experiments to find the best choice for your applicationâ€™s needs. As the industry frontier evolves, adapt quickly â€” LangChainâ€™s abstractions keep you moving without losing momentum.

LangChainâ€™s ecosystem
---------------------

While the LangChain framework can be used standalone, it also integrates seamlessly with any LangChain product, giving developers a full suite of tools when building LLM applications.

To improve your LLM application development, pair LangChain with:

-   LangSmith - Helpful for agent evals and observability. Debug poor-performing LLM app runs, evaluate agent trajectories, gain visibility in production, and improve performance over time.
-   LangGraph - Build agents that can reliably handle complex tasks with LangGraph, our low-level agent orchestration framework. LangGraph offers customizable architecture, long-term memory, and human-in-the-loop workflows â€” and is trusted in production by companies like LinkedIn, Uber, Klarna, and GitLab.
-   LangGraph Platform - Deploy and scale agents effortlessly with a purpose-built deployment platform for long running, stateful workflows. Discover, reuse, configure, and share agents across teams â€” and iterate quickly with visual prototyping in LangGraph Studio.
