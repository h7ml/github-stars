n.eko
=====

This app uses Web RTC to stream a desktop inside of a docker container, I made this because rabb.it went under and my internet can't handle streaming and discord keeps crashing when my friend attempts to. I just want to watch anime with my friends ·Éö(‡≤†Áõä‡≤†·Éö) so I started digging throughout the internet and found a few _kinda_ clones, but none of them had the virtual browser, then I found Turtus and I was able to figure out the rest. This is by no means a fully featured clone of rabbit, it hs only _one_ room. It's stateless, so no saved user names or passwords.

Features
--------

-   Text Chat (With basic markdown support, discord flavor)
-   Admin users (Kick, Ban & Force Give/Release Controls)
-   Clipboard synchronization (on supported browsers)
-   Emote overlay
-   Ignore user (chat and emotes)
-   Persistent settings

Why n.eko?
----------

I like cats üê± (`Neko` is the Japanese word for cat), I'm a weeb/nerd

_**But why the cat butt?**_ Because cats are _assholes_, but you love them anyways.
