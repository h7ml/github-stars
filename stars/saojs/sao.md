ATTENTION: I'm working on SAO v2 without an ETA, if you want to get it shipped faster, please consider sponsoring me.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

Motivation
----------

**SAO** was made because **yeoman**, while powerful, is too complex. **vue-cli**, on the other hand, is more than a scaffolding tool and lacks some important features like _unit testing_. **SAO** combines the powerful core features of **yeoman** with the simplicity of **vue-cli** into a single application.

**SAO** is compatible with:

-   Regular git repo (simply download it)
-   SAO generator as git repo
-   SAO generator as npm package
-   SAO generator in local folder

⚡ ️**Both repo and npm package can be used offline.**

Quick Start
-----------

npm i -g sao

# An official generator for creating a Node.js project
# Generate from git repo
sao saojs/sao-nm my-module
# Or from npm package (npm.im/sao-nm)
sao nm my-module
