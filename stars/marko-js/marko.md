Intro
-----

Marko is HTML _reimagined_ as a language for building dynamic and reactive user interfaces. Almost any valid HTML is valid Marko, and Marko extends HTML for building modern applications more declaratively. Among these extensions are conditionals and lists, state, and components.

Marko supports both single-file components and components across separate files.

### Single-file component

The following renders a button and a counter of how many times the button has been pressed:

**click-count.marko**

class {
  onCreate() {
    this.state \= { count: 0 };
  }
  increment() {
    this.state.count++;
  }
}

style {
  .count {
    color: #09c;
    font-size: 3em;
  }
  .press-me {
    padding: 0.5em;
  }
}

<output.count\>
  ${state.count}
</output\>
<button.press-me on-click('increment')\>
  Press me!
</button\>

### Multi-file component

The same component as above, but split into:

-   `index.marko` template file
-   `component.js` component JS logic file
-   `style.css` component styles file

**index.marko**

<output.count\>
  ${state.count}
</output\>
<button.press-me on-click('increment')\>
  Press me!
</button\>

**component.js**

export default {
  onCreate() {
    this.state \= { count: 0 };
  },
  increment() {
    this.state.count++;
  },
};

**style.css**

.count {
  color: #09c;
  font-size: 3em;
}
.press-me {
  padding: 0.5em;
}

Concise Syntax
--------------

Marko also supports a beautifully concise syntax as an alternative to its HTML syntax:

Concise syntax

HTML syntax

ul.example-list
  for|color| of\=\[a, b, c\]
    li -- ${color}

<ul class\="example-list"\>
  <for|color| of\=\[a, b, c\]\>
    <li\>${color}</li\>
  </for\>
</ul\>
