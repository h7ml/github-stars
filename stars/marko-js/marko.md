Intro
-----

Marko is HTML _reimagined_ as a language for building dynamic and reactive user interfaces. Almost any valid HTML is valid Marko, and Marko extends HTML for building modern applications more declaratively. Among these extensions are components, conditionals and loops, and a full reactivity system.

### Example Component

The following renders a button and a counter of how many times the button has been pressed:

**click-count.marko**

// HTML + JavaScript = ðŸ’œ
<let/count\=0\>
<button onClick() { count++ }\>
  Clicked ${count} times
</button\>
