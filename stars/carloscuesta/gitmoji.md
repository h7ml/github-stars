About
-----

Gitmoji is an initiative to standardize and explain **the use of emojis on GitHub commit messages**.

**Using emojis** on **commit messages** provides an **easy way** of **identifying the purpose or intention of a commit** with only looking at the emojis used. As there are a lot of different emojis I found the need of creating a guide that can help to use emojis easier.

The gitmojis are published on the following package in order to be used as a dependency üì¶.

Using gitmoji-cli
-----------------

To use gitmojis from your command line install gitmoji-cli. A gitmoji interactive client for using emojis on commit messages.

npm i -g gitmoji-cli

Example of usage
----------------

In case you need some ideas to integrate gitmoji in your project, here's a practical way to use it:

```
<intention> [scope?][:?] <message>
```

-   `intention`: An emoji from the list.
-   `scope`: An optional string that adds contextual information for the scope of the change.
-   `message`: A brief explanation of the change.
