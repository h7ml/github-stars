_screen sharing for developers_

Intro
-----

In the past I've had some problems sharing my screen with coworkers using corporate chatting solutions like Microsoft Teams. I wanted to show them some of my code, but either the stream lagged several seconds behind or the quality was so poor that my colleagues couldn't read the code. Or both.

That's why I created screego. It allows you to share your screen with good quality and low latency. Screego is an addition to existing software and only helps to share your screen. Nothing else (:.

Features
--------

-   Multi User Screenshare
-   Secure transfer via WebRTC
-   Low latency / High resolution
-   Simple Install via Docker / single binary
-   Integrated TURN Server see NAT Traversal
