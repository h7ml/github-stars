Cube Coach
==========

> An interactive guide to solving the Rubik's cube

A progressive web app built to help demonstrate all the optimal F2L, OLL and PLL moves when solving the Rubik's Cube by means of the CFOP method. Inspired and powered by code from a google doodle once upon a time.

Features
--------

-   Interact with the cube via mouse or touch
-   Setup the cube for a specific move then execute it to solve
-   Speed up or slow down execution
-   Execute more than once to find recurring patterns
-   Reverse executions to repeat a scenario
