Why Do You Need It?
-------------------

After communicating with thousands of developers, I found many strong needs as below.

1.  **Skill Improvement**: Learn more tricks and get more practical experience
2.  **Well-organized Project Templates**: Speed up project development.
3.  **High-Quality Framework**: Useful Solutions to solve plenty of basic requirements and problems.

So I wrote and open-source the `OpenTGX` project.

Most of the content is based on my 15y+ experience in game development. It's not perfect but can solve many problems to speed up your development progress and make your project management easier when working together with many team members.

More and more components will be added in the future, such as networking, 2d games components, 3d games components, etc.

From this, Mr Kylin(me) will work together with other developers based on `OpenTGX` to give you more projects, examples, and tutorials which we think can help you a lot.

I hope more and more developers join us to make `OpenTGX` better.
