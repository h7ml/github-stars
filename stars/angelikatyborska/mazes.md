Mazes
=====

A maze generator. Deployed at mazes.angelika.me.

Setup
-----

To start your Phoenix server:

-   Install Elixir, Erlang, and NodeJS with `asdf install`
-   Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
-   Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
-   Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit `localhost:5000` from your browser.

Tests
-----

The unit tests require a HTMl validator server running at `localhost:8888` (see vnu-elixir). Start it with:

```
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 validator/validator:latest
```
