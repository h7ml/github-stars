------------------------------------

  

Web Demos

Requirements
------------

If you have CUDA graphic card, please follow the requirements of NVlabs/stylegan3.

The usual installation steps involve the following commands, they should set up the correct CUDA version and all the python packages

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate stylegan3
```

Then install the additional requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Otherwise (for GPU acceleration on MacOS with Silicon Mac M1/M2, or just CPU) try the following:

cat environment.yml | \\
  grep -v -E 'nvidia|cuda' \> environment-no-nvidia.yml && \\
    conda env create -f environment-no-nvidia.yml
conda activate stylegan3

# On MacOS
export PYTORCH\_ENABLE\_MPS\_FALLBACK=1

Run Gradio visualizer in Docker
-------------------------------

Provided docker image is based on NGC PyTorch repository. To quickly try out visualizer in Docker, run the following:

# before you build the docker container, make sure you have cloned this repo, and downloaded the pretrained model by \`python scripts/download\_model.py\`.
docker build . -t draggan:latest  
docker run -p 7860:7860 -v "$PWD":/workspace/src -it draggan:latest bash
# (Use GPU)if you want to utilize your Nvidia gpu to accelerate in docker, please add command tag \`--gpus all\`, like:
#   docker run --gpus all  -p 7860:7860 -v "$PWD":/workspace/src -it draggan:latest bash

cd src && python visualizer\_drag\_gradio.py --listen

Now you can open a shared link from Gradio (printed in the terminal console).  
Beware the Docker image takes about 25GB of disk space!

Download pre-trained StyleGAN2 weights
--------------------------------------

To download pre-trained weights, simply run:

```
python scripts/download_model.py
```

If you want to try StyleGAN-Human and the Landscapes HQ (LHQ) dataset, please download weights from these links: StyleGAN-Human, LHQ, and put them under `./checkpoints`.

Feel free to try other pretrained StyleGAN.

Run DragGAN GUI
---------------

To start the DragGAN GUI, simply run:

sh scripts/gui.sh

If you are using windows, you can run:

```
.\scripts\gui.bat
```

This GUI supports editing GAN-generated images. To edit a real image, you need to first perform GAN inversion using tools like PTI. Then load the new latent code and model weights to the GUI.

You can run DragGAN Gradio demo as well, this is universal for both windows and linux:

python visualizer\_drag\_gradio.py
