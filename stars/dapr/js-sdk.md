Dapr SDK for JavaScript
=======================

Getting Started
---------------

Instantly get started by installing the Dapr JS SDK and reading the getting started documentation or follow one of the quickstarts

```
npm install --save @dapr/dapr
```

You can also use the development version of the SDK which is built from the `main` branch. Make sure to remove the `@dapr/dapr` package first. This package is not meant for production use, and should only be used for development purposes.

```
npm install --save @dapr/dapr-dev
```
