This monorepo uses `yarn`, so to start you'll need the package manager installed.

To run E2E tests you'll also need Playwright set up, which can be done locally via `npx playwright install`. Afterward, run `yarn start:app` and in a separate tab run `yarn e2e:ui` to boot up the test runner.

When you're done with your changes, we use changesets to manage release notes. Run `yarn changeset` to autogenerate notes to be appended to your pull request.

Thank you!
