ntfy.sh | Send push notifications to your phone or desktop via PUT/POST
=======================================================================

**ntfy** (pronounced "_notify_") is a simple HTTP-based pub-sub notification service. With ntfy, you can **send notifications to your phone or desktop via scripts** from any computer, **without having to sign up or pay any fees**. If you'd like to run your own instance of the service, you can easily do so since ntfy is open source.

You can access the free version of ntfy at **ntfy.sh**. There is also an open-source Android app available on Google Play or F-Droid, as well as an open source iOS app available on the App Store.

I now offer paid plans for ntfy.sh if you don't want to self-host, or you want to support the development of ntfy (‚Üí Purchase via web app). You can **buy a plan for as low as $5/month**. You can also donate via GitHub Sponsors, and Liberapay. I would be very humbled by your sponsorship. ‚ù§Ô∏è
