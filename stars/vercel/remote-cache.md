Summary
-------

Remote Computation Caching (or just Remote Caching) is a feature of advanced build tools like Turborepo, Bazel, and Buck to cache compiled computations and code artifacts in the cloud with the hope of recycling them across machines to reduce overall build/computation time. The key idea is that you "never recompute work thatâ€™s already been done before."

> Through Vercel's Remote Caching API, teams can leverage this advanced primitive without needing to think about hosting, infrastructure, or maintenance.

This repository holds the source code to the Vercel Remote Caching SDK as well as examples of build systems that leverage it. For those looking to integrate their build systems with Vercel Remote Caching, you've come to the right place. The @vercel/remote SDK is a thin layer over our existing REST API. We've provided packages that implement this SDK for Nx and Rush build tools. See our examples list of build systems using the Vercel Remote Cache.
