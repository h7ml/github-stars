React on the Edge
=================

Warning

Edge Functions have been deprecated. We recommend using the full Node.js runtime with Fluid compute instead. Learn more here or read the docs. Functions using Fluid retain the benefits of Edge Functions, without the downsides of the limited Edge runtime. Further, most workloads have 1-3 regions for their data storage, where you should co-locate your compute. Ensure your Vercel Function region is the same as your database.
