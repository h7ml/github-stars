LocatorJS
=========

Click on UI Component in the browser to open its code in your IDE.

go to www.locatorjs.com for more info

Note

LocatorJS is currently not compatible with Next.js 15+.

Currently, the only thing I can recommend is to use an alternative like code-inspector-plugin which is based on Webpack.

Install Browser extension
-------------------------

Install extension from Chrome Web Store (works for Chrome, Brave, Opera and Edge)

Install extension from Firefox Add-ons

Extension readme (requirements, troubleshooting, etc)

Install as a library (or combination with extension)
