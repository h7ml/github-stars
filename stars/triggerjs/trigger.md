Trigger JS
==========

_Create scroll-based animation without JavaScript._

Sometimes we want to update the CSS style of an HTML element based on the scroll position, just like fast-forwarding or rewinding a video by scrolling up and down.

With Trigger JS, get the desired value with CSS variable on page scroll for your animation needed, without writing a single line of JavaScript code, configuration with HTML attributes. Checkout examples here.

Getting Started
---------------

#### Method 1: Via CDN

1.  Include Trigger JS to your webpage with a script tag, with either CDN:
    
    -   UNPKG CDN:
    
    <script src\="//unpkg.com/@triggerjs/trigger" defer\></script\>
    
    -   jsDelivr CDN:
    
    <script src\="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@triggerjs/trigger" defer\></script\>
    
2.  Add `tg-name` to the DOM element that you want to monitor. The value of `tg-name` is the name of the CSS variable that binds to the element.
    

<div tg-name\="scrolled" id\="greeting"\>Hello, World</div\>

In the above example, CSS variable `--scrolled` is added to the selector `#greeting`:

<style\>
  body {
    padding: 100vh 0; /\* In order to make the page have enough room for scrolling \*/
  }

  #greeting {
    transform: translateX(
      calc(var(\--scrolled) \* 1px)
    ); /\* Converts to px unit \*/
  }
</style\>

1.  Scroll the page and see the result.

#### Method 2: Build from source

1.  Get the library in either way:
    
    -   From GitHub
    
    git clone https://github.com/triggerjs/trigger.git
    
    -   From NPM
    
    npm i @triggerjs/trigger
    
2.  Change to the directory, install the dependencies:
    
    npm install
    
3.  There is a pre-built version `bundle.js` located in `dist`. Run a local web server and browse the greeting example in `index.html` :
    1.  For example, type `npx serve` in the terminal
    2.  Open up `http://localhost:5000` in web browser.
    3.  Scroll the page and see the result.
4.  The following command will build a new version to `dist/bundle.js`:
    -   For development (with watch):
        
        npm run watch
        
    -   For development:
        
        npm run build
        
    -   For production:
        
        npm run prod
        

The `tg-` Attributes
--------------------

Attribute

Type

Default

Description

`tg-name`

Required

\-

The CSS variable name to store the value, with or without `--` prefix.

`tg-from`

Optional

`0`

The start value

`tg-to`

Optional

`1`

The end value

`tg-steps`

Optional

`100`

Steps to be triggered from `tg-from` to `tg-to`

`tg-step`

Optional

`0`

Step per increment. If this value isn't `0`, will override `tg-steps`.

`tg-map`

Optional

(Empty)

Map the value to another value. Format:  
\- 1-to-1 mapping: `value: newValue; value2: newValue2`.  
\- Multiple-to-1 mapping: `value,value2,value3: newValue`.  
\- Range-to-1 mapping: `value...value2: newValue`.

`tg-filter`

Optional

(Empty)

Only trigger if the scroll value is on the list. Format: `1,3,5,7,9`. By default, the filter mode is `retain`. If we want to switch the mode to `exact`, add an `!` at the end of the value. Read more about this in the dedicated section following.

`tg-edge`

Optional

cover

Calculate the start and end of the scrolling effect. `cover` means off-screen to off-screen. The calculation starts in the appearance of the element at the bottom, and ends in the disappearance of element at the top; `inset` represents the calculation begins after the top edge of the element touches the top of the screen, ends when the bottom edge of the element reached the bottom of the screen. See below section for a diagram.

`tg-follow`

Optional

(Empty)

Use the result calculated from another element. The value of `tg-follow` is the value of the target element's `tg-ref`. **Caution**: When `tg-follow` is set, `tg-from`, `tg-to`, `tg-steps`, `tg-step` and `tg-edge` are ignored in the same element.

`tg-ref`

Optional

(Empty)

Define the name for other elements to reference using `tg-follow`.

`tg-bezier`

Optional

(Empty)

Bezier easing setting, available values: `ease`, `easeIn`, `easeOut`, `easeInOut`, or custom numbers for a Cubic Bezier in format `p1x,p1y,p2x,p2y`.

Value Mapping
-------------

Number is not suitable for all the situations. For example, we want to update the text color based on the scroll value. the attribute `tg-map` can help.

The following example shows how to update the text color with the rules below:

Element Position (From the Bottom)

Scroll Value

Text Color

0% - 10%

1

black

10% - 20%

2

red

20% - 30%

3

orange

30% - 40%

4

yellow

40% - 50%

5

green

50% - 60%

6

cyan

60% - 70%

7

blue

70% - 80%

8

purple

80% - 90%

9

grey

90% - 100%

10

grey

<h1
  id\="heading"
  tg-name\="color"
  tg-from\="1"
  tg-to\="10"
  tg-steps\="9"
  tg-map\="1: black; 2: red; 3: orange; 4: yellow; 5: green; 6: cyan; 7: blue; 8: purple; 9,10: grey"
\>
  Rainbow Text
</h1\>

<style\>
  body {
    padding: 100vh 0; /\* In order to make the page have enough rooms for scrolling \*/
  }

  #heading {
    color: var(\--color);
  }
</style\>

Steps & Step
------------

Let's say `tg-from="200"` and `tg-to="-200"`, we want to move the element in x position with `transform: translateX()`. `tg-steps` lets us define how many steps from `200` to `-200`, for example, `tg-steps="400"` means run from `200` to `-200` with `400` steps, `1` per increment; In other words, `tg-steps="800"` means `0.5` per increment.

But sometimes, we do not want to do the math by ourselves, that's why `tg-step` exists. `tg-step` defines the exact value of increment. Please note that if `tg-step` is defined, `tg-steps` will be ignored.

Noise Reduction
---------------

Sometimes we are only interested in certain values. For example, we only want to know when `25, 50, 75` show up from `0` to `100` (`tg-from="0"` and `tg-to="100"`). In this situation, `tg-filter` helps you.

<h1
  id\="heading"
  tg-name\="color"
  tg-from\="0"
  tg-to\="100"
  tg-step\="1"
  tg-filter\="25,50,75"
  tg-map\="25: red; 50: yellow; 75: green"
\>
  Red (25), Yellow (50), Green (75)
</h1\>

<style\>
  body {
    padding: 100vh 0; /\* In order to make the page have enough rooms for scrolling \*/
  }

  #heading {
    color: var(\--color);
  }
</style\>

The mode of `tg-filter`
-----------------------

There are two modes for `tg-filter`, `retain` by default, the other one is `exact`. Here is an example to clarify this:

<h1
  id\="heading"
  tg-name\="color"
  tg-from\="0"
  tg-to\="10"
  tg-step\="1"
  tg-filter\="5"
  tg-map\="5: blue"
\>
  Trigger.js
</h1\>

<style\>
  body {
    padding: 100vh 0; /\* In order to make the page have enough rooms for scrolling \*/
  }

  #heading {
    \--color: black;
    color: var(\--color);
  }
</style\>

In the above example, the text has an initial color of black, and it will turn to blue when it arrives at the middle of the page and never turn to black again because there is no trigger point of the black color.

So let's say we want the text color becomes blue only when the calculation value is `5`, and becomes black for other values, We can change it to:

<h1
  id\="heading"
  tg-name\="color"
  tg-from\="0"
  tg-to\="10"
  tg-step\="1"
  tg-filter\="4,5,6"
  tg-map\="4: black; 5: blue; 6: black"
\>
  Trigger.js
</h1\>

It works, but the code becomes redundant. To solve this, we can switch the filter mode to `exact` by adding an `!` at the end of the value of `tg-filter`:

<h1
  id\="heading"
  tg-name\="color"
  tg-from\="0"
  tg-to\="10"
  tg-step\="1"
  tg-filter\="5!"
  tg-map\="5: blue"
\>
  Trigger.js
</h1\>

In `exact` mode, `--color` becomes `blue` when the value is `5`, and becomes the default when the value is not `5`.

The design of adding `!` to the value of `tg-filter` is the demand is exclusive to the attribute. Establishing another attribute for the mode is unnecessary or even leads to the misunderstanding.

Value Inheritance
-----------------

Just like some CSS properties, the values of `tg-` attributes (except `tg-follow`, `tg-ref`) inherits from the parents if not being set in the current element. If we do not want it inherits from parent and set it as default value, just add the `tg-` attribute without value. For example:

<div tg-name\="scale" tg-from\="0" tg-to\="50"\>
  <span tg-name\="color" tg-to\>
    <!-- The value of tg-to is now 1 (Default value) -->
  </span\>
</div\>

`tg-edge` Explaination
----------------------

The different between `cover` (default) and `edge`:

So that if `tg-edge="inset"`, the element must be higher than the viewport (`window.clientHeight`).

JavaScript Event
----------------

We can also listen to the `tg` event on an element with JavaScript:

<h1
  id\="heading"
  tg-name\="color"
  tg-from\="1"
  tg-to\="3"
  tg-steps\="2"
  tg-map\="1:#000;2:#666;3:#ccc"
\>
  Trigger JS
</h1\>

<style\>
  body {
    padding: 100vh 0; /\* In order to make the page have enough room for scrolling \*/
  }

  #heading {
    color: var(\--color);
  }
</style\>

<script\>
  document.querySelector('#heading').addEventListener('tg', (e) \=> {
    console.log(e.detail); // {value: '#666'}
  });
</script\>

Customising the Prefix
----------------------

If you are concerned with the `tg-` prefix that doesn't quite fulfill the standard of HTML5, it can be customised by the following setting in the `body` tag with `data-trigger-prefix` attribute:

<body data-trigger-prefix\="data-tg"\>
  <div data-tg-name\="scrolled" id\="greeting"\>Hello, World</div\>
</body\>

The above example customises the prefix to `data-tg`. `data-*` is a completely valid attribute for putting custom data in HTML5.
