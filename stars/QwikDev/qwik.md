Instant-loading web apps, without effort
========================================

Qwik offers the fastest possible page load times - regardless of the complexity of your website. Qwik is so fast because it allows fully interactive sites to load with almost no JavaScript and pickup from where the server left off.

As users interact with the site, only the necessary parts of the site load on-demand. This precision lazy-loading is what makes Qwik so quick.
