> A fun location for your third-party scripts to hang out

Partytown is a lazy-loaded library to help relocate resource intensive scripts into a web worker, and off of the main thread. Its goal is to help speed up sites by dedicating the main thread to your code, and offloading third-party scripts to a web worker.

> Note: Partytown is still in beta and not guaranteed to work in every scenario. Please see our FAQ and Trade-Off sections for more info.

The philosophy is that the main thread should be dedicated to your code, and any scripts that are not required to be in the critical path should be moved to a web worker. Main thread performance is, without question, more important than web worker thread performance.
