This repository currently holds the following projects:

-   `Nx` - Multi-dimensional arrays (tensors) and numerical definitions for Elixir
    
-   `EXLA` - Google's XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) compiler/backend for Nx
    
-   `Torchx` - LibTorch backend for Nx
    

Each has their own README, which you can access above to learn more. They will be extracted to their own repository in the future. Examples and benchmarks are available in the `EXLA` project.

Check our organization page for a general introduction to Machine Learning in Elixir.
