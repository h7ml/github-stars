Develop and build
-----------------

### Development

-   Install Node.js
-   Change to the folder `./`, run `npm install` to install dependented libraries
-   Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
-   Then run `npm run start` to start the app for developing or debuging

### Build and package

-   It is recommended to use electron-builder for packaging
-   Go to the `./` folder
-   Run `npm run build`
-   Run `npm run make`, if everything goes well, the packaged files will be in the `./dist` folder.
-   This command may take several minutes to finish when you run it the first time, as it needs time to download dependent files. You can download the dependencies manually here, or Taobao mirror, then save the files to `~/.electron` . You can check the Electron Docs for more infomation.

# build
npm run build

# make
npm run make # the packed files will be in ./dist
