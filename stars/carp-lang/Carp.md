We now have an official Discord server (invite) - future discussions about the language will most likely happen there, come join!

_WARNING! This is a research project and a lot of information here might become outdated and misleading without any explanation. Don't use it for anything important just yet!_

_Version 0.5.5 of the language is out!_

About
-----

Carp is a programming language designed to work well for interactive and performance sensitive use cases like games, sound synthesis and visualizations.

The key features of Carp are the following:

-   Automatic and deterministic memory management (no garbage collector or VM)
-   Inferred static types for great speed and reliability
-   Ownership tracking enables a functional programming style while still using mutation of cache-friendly data structures under the hood
-   No hidden performance penalties – allocation and copying are explicit
-   Straightforward integration with existing C code
-   Lisp macros, compile time scripting and a helpful REPL

A Very Small Example
--------------------

(load-and-use SDL)

(defn tick \[state\]
  (+ state 10))

(defn draw \[app rend state\]
  (bg rend &(rgb (/ @state 2) (/ @state 3) (/ @state 4))))

(defn main \[\]
  (let \[app (SDLApp.create "The Minimalistic Color Generator" 400 300)
        state 0\]
    (SDLApp.run-with-callbacks &app SDLApp.quit-on-esc tick draw state)))
