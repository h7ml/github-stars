Using Machine Learning with Detectron2

What's New
----------

-   Includes new capabilities such as panoptic segmentation, Densepose, Cascade R-CNN, rotated bounding boxes, PointRend, DeepLab, ViTDet, MViTv2 etc.
-   Used as a library to support building research projects on top of it.
-   Models can be exported to TorchScript format or Caffe2 format for deployment.
-   It trains much faster.
