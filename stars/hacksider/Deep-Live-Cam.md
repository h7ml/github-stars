Deep-Live-Cam
=============

Real-time face swap and video deepfake with a single click and only a single image.

Disclaimer
----------

This software is intended as a productive contribution to the AI-generated media industry. It aims to assist artists with tasks like animating custom characters or using them as models for clothing, etc.

We are aware of the potential for unethical applications and are committed to preventative measures. A built-in check prevents the program from processing inappropriate media (nudity, graphic content, sensitive material like war footage, etc.). We will continue to develop this project responsibly, adhering to law and ethics. We may shut down the project or add watermarks if legally required.

Users are expected to use this software responsibly and legally. If using a real person's face, obtain their consent and clearly label any output as a deepfake when sharing online. We are not responsible for end-user actions.

Quick Start (Windows / Nvidia)
------------------------------

Download latest pre-built version with CUDA support - No Manual Installation/Downloading required and Early features testing.

Installation (Manual)
---------------------

**Please be aware that the installation needs technical skills and is not for beginners, consider downloading the prebuilt.**

### Installation

This is more likely to work on your computer but will be slower as it utilizes the CPU.

**1\. Setup Your Platform**

-   Python (3.10 recommended)
-   pip
-   git
-   ffmpeg
-   Visual Studio 2022 Runtimes (Windows)

**2\. Clone Repository**

https://github.com/hacksider/Deep-Live-Cam.git

**3\. Download Models**

1.  GFPGANv1.4
2.  inswapper\_128\_fp16.onnx (Note: Use this replacement version if you encounter issues)

Place these files in the "**models**" folder.

**4\. Install Dependencies**

We highly recommend using a `venv` to avoid issues.

pip install -r requirements.txt

**For macOS:** Install or upgrade the `python-tk` package:

brew install python-tk@3.10

**Run:** If you don't have a GPU, you can run Deep-Live-Cam using `python run.py`. Note that initial execution will download models (~300MB).

### GPU Acceleration

**CUDA Execution Provider (Nvidia)**

1.  Install CUDA Toolkit 11.8
2.  Install dependencies:

pip uninstall onnxruntime onnxruntime-gpu
pip install onnxruntime-gpu==1.16.3

1.  Usage:

python run.py --execution-provider cuda

**CoreML Execution Provider (Apple Silicon)**

1.  Install dependencies:

pip uninstall onnxruntime onnxruntime-silicon
pip install onnxruntime-silicon==1.13.1

1.  Usage:

python run.py --execution-provider coreml

**CoreML Execution Provider (Apple Legacy)**

1.  Install dependencies:

pip uninstall onnxruntime onnxruntime-coreml
pip install onnxruntime-coreml==1.13.1

1.  Usage:

python run.py --execution-provider coreml

**DirectML Execution Provider (Windows)**

1.  Install dependencies:

pip uninstall onnxruntime onnxruntime-directml
pip install onnxruntime-directml==1.15.1

1.  Usage:

python run.py --execution-provider directml

**OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ Execution Provider (Intel)**

1.  Install dependencies:

pip uninstall onnxruntime onnxruntime-openvino
pip install onnxruntime-openvino==1.15.0

1.  Usage:

python run.py --execution-provider openvino

Usage
-----

**1\. Image/Video Mode**

-   Execute `python run.py`.
-   Choose a source face image and a target image/video.
-   Click "Start".
-   The output will be saved in a directory named after the target video.

**2\. Webcam Mode**

-   Execute `python run.py`.
-   Select a source face image.
-   Click "Live".
-   Wait for the preview to appear (10-30 seconds).
-   Use a screen capture tool like OBS to stream.
-   To change the face, select a new source image.
