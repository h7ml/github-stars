Github Old Feed
===============

In the current feed, no matter how many filters I add, I can't find the information I'm interested in.  
I only care about the star and commit of people that I follow... and now I can't see that info.  
Don't the Devs that are taking care of these tasks use github?

Replace the shit💩 new feed with the old one.

Usage
-----

1.  Install Tampermonkey
2.  Install github-old-feed
3.  Refresh the github page! 🍀

**Before (the shit💩 new feed)**

**After use (the old one)**
