---

HLS.js is a JavaScript library that implements an HTTP Live Streaming client. It relies on HTML5 video and MediaSource Extensions for playback.

It works by transmuxing MPEG-2 Transport Stream and AAC/MP3 streams into ISO BMFF (MP4) fragments. Transmuxing is performed asynchronously using a Web Worker when available in the browser. HLS.js also supports HLS + fmp4, as announced during WWDC2016.

HLS.js works directly on top of a standard HTML`<video>` element.

HLS.js is written in ECMAScript6 (`*.js`) and TypeScript (`*.ts`) (strongly typed superset of ES6), and transpiled in ECMAScript5 using Babel and the TypeScript compiler.

Rollup is used to build the distro bundle and serve the local development environment.

### Not Supported

For a complete list of issues, see "Top priorities" in the Release Planning and Backlog project tab. Codec support is dependent on the runtime environment (for example, not all browsers on the same OS support HEVC).

-   `#EXT-X-I-FRAME-STREAM-INF` I-frame Media Playlist files
-   `REQ-VIDEO-LAYOUT` is not used in variant filtering or selection
-   "identity" format `SAMPLE-AES` method keys with fmp4, aac, mp3, vtt... segments (MPEG-2 TS only)
-   MPEG-2 TS segments with FairPlay Streaming, PlayReady, or Widevine encryption
-   FairPlay Streaming legacy keys (For com.apple.fps.1\_0 use native Safari playback)
-   MP3 elementary stream audio in IE and Edge (<=18) on Windows 10 (See #1641 and Microsoft answers forum)

### Server-side-rendering (SSR) and `require` from a Node.js runtime

You can safely require this library in Node and **absolutely nothing will happen**. A dummy object is exported so that requiring the library does not throw an error. HLS.js is not instantiable in Node.js. See #1841 for more details.

Getting started with development
--------------------------------

First, checkout the repository and install the required dependencies

git clone https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js.git
cd hls.js
# After cloning or pulling from the repository, make sure all dependencies are up-to-date
npm install ci
# Run dev-server for demo page (recompiles on file-watch, but doesn't write to actual dist fs artifacts)
npm run dev
# After making changes run the sanity-check task to verify all checks before committing changes
npm run sanity-check

The dev server will host files on port 8000. Once started, the demo can be found running at http://localhost:8000/demo/.

Before submitting a PR, please see our contribution guidelines. Join the discussion on Slack via video-dev.org in #hlsjs for updates and questions about development.

### Build tasks

Compatibility
-------------

HLS.js is only compatible with browsers supporting MediaSource extensions (MSE) API with 'video/MP4' mime-type inputs.

HLS.js is supported on:

-   Chrome 39+ for Android
-   Chrome 39+ for Desktop
-   Firefox 41+ for Android
-   Firefox 42+ for Desktop
-   Edge for Windows 10+
-   Safari 9+ for macOS 10.11+
-   Safari for iPadOS 13+
-   Safari for iOS 17.1+ since HLS version 1.5.0 using Managed Media Source (MMS) WebKit blog

A Promise polyfill is required in browsers missing native promise support.

**Please note:**

Safari browsers (iOS, iPadOS, and macOS) have built-in HLS support through the plain video "tag" source URL. See the example below (Using HLS.js) to run appropriate feature detection and choose between using HLS.js or natively built-in HLS support.

When a platform has neither MediaSource nor native HLS support, the browser cannot play HLS.

_Keep in mind that if the intention is to support HLS on multiple platforms, beyond those compatible with HLS.js, the HLS streams need to strictly follow the specifications of RFC8216, especially if apps, smart TVs, and set-top boxes are to be supported._

Find a support matrix of the MediaSource API here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaSource

Using HLS.js
------------

### Installation

Prepackaged builds are included with each release. Or install the hls.js as a dependency of your project:

npm install --save hls.js

A canary channel is also available if you prefer to work off the development branch (master):

```
npm install hls.js@canary
```

### Embedding HLS.js

Directly include dist/hls.js or dist/hls.min.js in a script tag on the page. This setup prioritizes HLS.js MSE playback over native browser support for HLS playback in HTMLMediaElements:

<script src\="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hls.js@1"\></script\>
<!-- Or if you want the latest version from the main branch -->
<!-- <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hls.js@canary"></script> -->
<video id\="video"\></video\>
<script\>
  var video \= document.getElementById('video');
  var videoSrc \= 'https://test-streams.mux.dev/x36xhzz/x36xhzz.m3u8';
  if (Hls.isSupported()) {
    var hls \= new Hls();
    hls.loadSource(videoSrc);
    hls.attachMedia(video);
  }
  // HLS.js is not supported on platforms that do not have Media Source
  // Extensions (MSE) enabled.
  //
  // When the browser has built-in HLS support (check using \`canPlayType\`),
  // we can provide an HLS manifest (i.e. .m3u8 URL) directly to the video
  // element through the \`src\` property. This is using the built-in support
  // of the plain video element, without using HLS.js.
  else if (video.canPlayType('application/vnd.apple.mpegurl')) {
    video.src \= videoSrc;
  }
</script\>

#### Alternative setup

To check for native browser support first and then fallback to HLS.js, swap these conditionals. See this comment to understand some of the tradeoffs.

<script src\="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hls.js@1"\></script\>
<!-- Or if you want the latest version from the main branch -->
<!-- <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hls.js@canary"></script> -->
<video id\="video"\></video\>
<script\>
  var video \= document.getElementById('video');
  var videoSrc \= 'https://test-streams.mux.dev/x36xhzz/x36xhzz.m3u8';
  //
  // First check for native browser HLS support
  //
  if (video.canPlayType('application/vnd.apple.mpegurl')) {
    video.src \= videoSrc;
    //
    // If no native HLS support, check if HLS.js is supported
    //
  } else if (Hls.isSupported()) {
    var hls \= new Hls();
    hls.loadSource(videoSrc);
    hls.attachMedia(video);
  }
</script\>

#### Ensure correct time in video

HLS transcoding of an original video file often pushes the time of the first frame a bit. If you depend on having an exact match of frame times between original video and HLS stream, you need to account for this:

let tOffset \= 0;
const getAppendedOffset \= (eventName, { frag }) \=> {
  if (frag.type \=== 'main' && frag.sn !== 'initSegment' && frag.elementaryStreams.video) {
    const { start, startDTS, startPTS, maxStartPTS, elementaryStreams } \= frag;
    tOffset \= elementaryStreams.video.startPTS \- start;
    hls.off(Hls.Events.BUFFER\_APPENDED, getAppendedOffset);
    console.log('video timestamp offset:', tOffset, { start, startDTS, startPTS, maxStartPTS, elementaryStreams });
  }
}
hls.on(Hls.Events.BUFFER\_APPENDED, getAppendedOffset);
// and account for this offset, for example like this:
const video \= document.querySelector('video');
video.addEventListener('timeupdate', () \=> setTime(Math.max(0, video.currentTime \- tOffset))
const seek \= (t) \=> video.currentTime \= t + tOffset;
const getDuration \= () \=> video.duration \- tOffset;

For more embed and API examples see docs/API.md.

CORS
----

All HLS resources must be delivered with CORS headers permitting `GET` requests.
