Installation
------------

PG Back Web is available as a Docker image. You just need to set 3 environment variables and you're good to go!

Here's an example of how you can run PG Back Web with Docker Compose, feel free to adapt it to your needs:

services:
  pgbackweb:
    image: eduardolat/pgbackweb:latest
    ports:
      - "8085:8085" # Access the web interface at http://localhost:8085
    volumes:
      - ./backups:/backups # If you only use S3 destinations, you don't need this volume
    environment:
      # Optional environment variables are ignored, see the configuration section below for more details
      PBW\_ENCRYPTION\_KEY: "my\_secret\_key" # Change this to a strong key
      PBW\_POSTGRES\_CONN\_STRING: "postgresql://postgres:password@postgres:5432/pgbackweb?sslmode=disable"
    depends\_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service\_healthy

  postgres:
    image: postgres:18
    environment:
      POSTGRES\_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES\_DB: pgbackweb
      POSTGRES\_PASSWORD: password
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    healthcheck:
      test: \["CMD-SHELL", "pg\_isready -U postgres"\]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

You can watch this youtube video to see how easy it is to set up PG Back Web.

Configuration
-------------

You only need to configure the following environment variables:

-   `PBW_ENCRYPTION_KEY`: Your encryption key. Generate a strong random one and store it in a safe place, as PG Back Web uses it to encrypt sensitive data.
    
-   `PBW_POSTGRES_CONN_STRING`: The connection string for the PostgreSQL database that will store PG Back Web data.
    
-   `PBW_LISTEN_HOST`: Optional. Host for the server to listen on, default 0.0.0.0
    
-   `PBW_LISTEN_PORT`: Optional. Port for the server to listen on, default 8085
    
-   `PBW_PATH_PREFIX`: Optional. Path prefix for the application URL. Use this when you want to serve the application under a subpath (e.g., `/pgbackweb`). Must start with `/` and not end with `/`. Default is empty.
    
-   `TZ`: Optional. Your timezone. Default is `UTC`. This impacts logging, backup filenames and default timezone in the web interface.
