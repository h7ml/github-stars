OpenFaaS ® - Serverless Functions Made Simple
---------------------------------------------

OpenFaaS® makes it easy for developers to deploy event-driven functions and microservices to Kubernetes without repetitive, boiler-plate coding. Package your code or an existing binary in an OCI-compatible image to get a highly scalable endpoint with auto-scaling and metrics.

**Highlights**

-   Ease of use through UI portal and _one-click_ install
-   Write services and functions in any language with Template Store or a Dockerfile
-   Build and ship your code in an OCI-compatible/Docker image
-   Portable: runs on existing hardware or public/private cloud by leveraging Kubernetes
-   CLI available with YAML format for templating and defining functions
-   Auto-scales as demand increases including to zero
-   Commercially supported Pro distribution by the team behind OpenFaaS

Overview of OpenFaaS (Serverless Functions Made Simple)
-------------------------------------------------------

> Conceptual architecture and stack, more detail available in the docs

### Code samples

You can generate new functions using the `faas-cli` and built-in templates or use any binary for Windows or Linux in a container.

Official templates exist for many popular languages and are easily extensible with Dockerfiles.

-   Node.js (`node12`) example:
    
    "use strict"
    
    module.exports \= async (event, context) \=> {
        return context
            .status(200)
            .headers({"Content-Type": "text/html"})
            .succeed(\`
            <h1>
                👋 Hello World 🌍
            </h1>\`);
    }
    
    _handler.js_
    
-   Python 3 example:
    
    import requests
    
    def handle(req):
        r \=  requests.get(req, timeout \= 1)
        return "{} => {:d}".format(req, r.status\_code)
    
    _handler.py_
    
-   Golang example (`golang-http`)
    
    package function
    
    import (
        "fmt"
        "net/http"
    
        handler "github.com/openfaas/templates-sdk/go-http"
    )
    
    // Handle a function invocation
    func Handle(req handler.Request) (handler.Response, error) {
        var err error
    
        message := fmt.Sprintf("Body: %s", string(req.Body))
    
        return handler.Response{
            Body:       \[\]byte(message),
            StatusCode: http.StatusOK,
        }, err
    }

### Official eBook and video workshop

The founder of OpenFaaS wrote _Serverless For Everyone Else_ to help developers understand the use-case for functions through practical hands-on exercises using JavaScript and Node.js. No programming experience is required to try the exercises.

The examples use the faasd project, which is an easy to use and lightweight way to start learning about OpenFaaS and functions.
