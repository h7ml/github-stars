Technical Introduction
======================

Portmaster is a privacy suite for your Windows and Linux desktop.

### Base Technology

-   Portmaster integrates into network stack using nfqueue on Linux and a kernel driver (WFP) on Windows.
-   Packets are intercepted at the raw packet level - every packet is seen and can be stopped.
-   Ownership of connections is found using eBPF and `/proc` on Linux and a kernel driver and the IP Helper API (`iphlpapi.dll`) on Windows.
-   Most settings can be defined per app, which can be matched in different ways.
-   Support for special processes with weird or concealed paths/actors:
    -   Snap, AppImage and Script support on Linux
    -   Windows Store apps and svchost.exe system services support on Windows
-   Everything is 100% local on your device. (except the SPN, naturally)
    -   Updates are fully signed and downloaded automatically.
    -   Intelligence data (block lists, geoip) is downloaded and applied automatically.
-   The Portmaster Core Service runs as a system service, the UI elements (App, Notifier) run in user context.
-   The main UI still uses electron as a wrapper :/ - but this will change in the future. You can also open the UI in the browser

### Feature: Secure DNS

-   Portmaster intercepts "astray" DNS queries and reroutes them to itself for seamless integration.
-   DNS queries are resolved by the default or configured DoT/DoH resolvers.
-   Full support for split horizon and horizon validation to defend against rebinding attacks.

### Feature: Privacy Filter

-   Define allowed network scopes: Localhost, LAN, Internet, P2P, Inbound.
-   Easy rules based on Internet entities: Domain, IP, Country and more.
-   Filter Lists block common malware, ad, tracker domains etc.

### Feature: Network History ($)

-   Record connections and their details in a local database and search all of it later
-   Auto-delete old history or delete on demand

### Feature: Bandwidth Visibility ($)

-   Monitor bandwidth usage per connection and app

### Feature: SPN - Safing Privacy Network ($$)

-   A Privacy Network aimed at use cases "between" VPN and Tor.
-   Uses onion encryption over multiple hops just like Tor.
-   Routes are chosen to cover most distance within the network to increase privacy.
-   Exits are chosen near the destination server. This automatically geo-unblocks in many cases.
-   Exclude apps and domains/entities from using SPN.
-   Change routing algorithm and focus per app.
-   Nodes are hosted by Safing (company behind Portmaster) and the community.
-   Speeds are pretty decent (>100MBit/s).
