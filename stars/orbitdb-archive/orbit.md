Orbit
=====

> A distributed, serverless, peer-to-peer chat application on IPFS.

If you're here, you're probably looking for:

-   **orbit-db** - The decentralized databases project
-   **orbit-web** - The current repository behind Orbit Chat, a p2p chat running on orbitdb.

No work is currently being done in this repository.

#### Try the web app at https://orbit.chat

**NOTE!** _Orbit is still more or less experimental. It means Orbit is currently **not secure**, APIs will change and clients can break over time. If you come across problems, it would help greatly to open issues so that we can fix them as quickly as possible._
