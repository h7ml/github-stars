üìñ What is Ludwig?
==================

Ludwig is a **low-code** framework for building **custom** AI models like **LLMs** and other deep neural networks.

Key features:

-   üõ† **Build custom models with ease:** a declarative YAML configuration file is all you need to train a state-of-the-art LLM on your data. Support for multi-task and multi-modality learning. Comprehensive config validation detects invalid parameter combinations and prevents runtime failures.
-   ‚ö° **Optimized for scale and efficiency:** automatic batch size selection, distributed training (DDP, DeepSpeed), parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), 4-bit quantization (QLoRA), paged and 8-bit optimizers, and larger-than-memory datasets.
-   üìê **Expert level control:** retain full control of your models down to the activation functions. Support for hyperparameter optimization, explainability, and rich metric visualizations.
-   üß± **Modular and extensible:** experiment with different model architectures, tasks, features, and modalities with just a few parameter changes in the config. Think building blocks for deep learning.
-   üö¢ **Engineered for production:** prebuilt Docker containers, native support for running with Ray on Kubernetes, export models to Torchscript and Triton, upload to HuggingFace with one command.

Ludwig is hosted by the Linux Foundation AI & Data.

üíæ Installation

Large Language Model Fine-Tuning
--------------------------------

Let's fine-tune a pretrained LLaMA-2-7b large language model to follow instructions like a chatbot ("instruction tuning").

### Prerequisites

-   HuggingFace API Token
-   Access approval to Llama2-7b-hf
-   GPU with at least 12 GiB of VRAM (in our tests, we used an Nvidia T4)

### Running

We'll use the Stanford Alpaca dataset, which will be formatted as a table-like file that looks like this:

instruction

input

output

Arrange the items given below in the order to ...

cake, me, eating

I eating cake.

...

...

...

Create a YAML config file named `model.yaml` with the following:

model\_type: llm
base\_model: meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf

quantization:
  bits: 4

adapter:
  type: lora

prompt:
  template: |
    Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that may provide further context.
    Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
    ### Instruction:
    {instruction}
    ### Input:
    {input}
    ### Response:
input\_features:
  - name: prompt
    type: text

output\_features:
  - name: output
    type: text

trainer:
  type: finetune
  learning\_rate: 0.0001
  batch\_size: 1
  gradient\_accumulation\_steps: 16
  epochs: 3
  learning\_rate\_scheduler:
    decay: cosine
    warmup\_fraction: 0.01

preprocessing:
  sample\_ratio: 0.1

backend:
  type: local

And now let's train the model:

export HUGGING\_FACE\_HUB\_TOKEN = "<api\_token>"

ludwig train --config model.yaml --dataset "ludwig://alpaca"

Supervised ML
-------------

Let's build a neural network that predicts whether a given movie critic's review on Rotten Tomatoes was positive or negative.

Our dataset will be a CSV file that looks like this:

movie\_title

content\_rating

genres

runtime

top\_critic

review\_content

recommended

Deliver Us from Evil

R

Action & Adventure, Horror

117.0

TRUE

Director Scott Derrickson and his co-writer, Paul Harris Boardman, deliver a routine procedural with unremarkable frights.

0

Barbara

PG-13

Art House & International, Drama

105.0

FALSE

Somehow, in this stirring narrative, Barbara manages to keep hold of her principles, and her humanity and courage, and battles to save a dissident teenage girl whose life the Communists are trying to destroy.

1

Horrible Bosses

R

Comedy

98.0

FALSE

These bosses cannot justify either murder or lasting comic memories, fatally compromising a farce that could have been great but ends up merely mediocre.

0

Download a sample of the dataset from here.

wget https://ludwig.ai/latest/data/rotten\_tomatoes.csv

Next create a YAML config file named `model.yaml` with the following:

input\_features:
  - name: genres
    type: set
    preprocessing:
      tokenizer: comma
  - name: content\_rating
    type: category
  - name: top\_critic
    type: binary
  - name: runtime
    type: number
  - name: review\_content
    type: text
    encoder:
      type: embed
output\_features:
  - name: recommended
    type: binary

That's it! Now let's train the model:

ludwig train --config model.yaml --dataset rotten\_tomatoes.csv

**Happy modeling**

‚ùì Why you should use Ludwig
===========================

-   **Minimal machine learning boilerplate**
    
    Ludwig takes care of the engineering complexity of machine learning out of the box, enabling research scientists to focus on building models at the highest level of abstraction. Data preprocessing, hyperparameter optimization, device management, and distributed training for `torch.nn.Module` models come completely free.
    
-   **Easily build your benchmarks**
    
    Creating a state-of-the-art baseline and comparing it with a new model is a simple config change.
    
-   **Easily apply new architectures to multiple problems and datasets**
    
    Apply new models across the extensive set of tasks and datasets that Ludwig supports. Ludwig includes a full benchmarking toolkit accessible to any user, for running experiments with multiple models across multiple datasets with just a simple configuration.
    
-   **Highly configurable data preprocessing, modeling, and metrics**
    
    Any and all aspects of the model architecture, training loop, hyperparameter search, and backend infrastructure can be modified as additional fields in the declarative configuration to customize the pipeline to meet your requirements. For details on what can be configured, check out Ludwig Configuration docs.
    
-   **Multi-modal, multi-task learning out-of-the-box**
    
    Mix and match tabular data, text, images, and even audio into complex model configurations without writing code.
    
-   **Rich model exporting and tracking**
    
    Automatically track all trials and metrics with tools like Tensorboard, Comet ML, Weights & Biases, MLFlow, and Aim Stack.
    
-   **Automatically scale training to multi-GPU, multi-node clusters**
    
    Go from training on your local machine to the cloud without code changes.
    
-   **Low-code interface for state-of-the-art models, including pre-trained Huggingface Transformers**
    
    Ludwig also natively integrates with pre-trained models, such as the ones available in Huggingface Transformers. Users can choose from a vast collection of state-of-the-art pre-trained PyTorch models to use without needing to write any code at all. For example, training a BERT-based sentiment analysis model with Ludwig is as simple as:
    
    ludwig train --dataset sst5 --config\_str "{input\_features: \[{name: sentence, type: text, encoder: bert}\], output\_features: \[{name: label, type: category}\]}"
    
-   **Low-code interface for AutoML**
    
    Ludwig AutoML allows users to obtain trained models by providing just a dataset, the target column, and a time budget.
    
    auto\_train\_results \= ludwig.automl.auto\_train(dataset\=my\_dataset\_df, target\=target\_column\_name, time\_limit\_s\=7200)
    
-   **Easy productionisation**
    
    Ludwig makes it easy to serve deep learning models, including on GPUs. Launch a REST API for your trained Ludwig model.
    
    ludwig serve --model\_path=/path/to/model
    
    Ludwig supports exporting models to efficient Torchscript bundles.
    
    ludwig export\_torchscript -‚Äìmodel\_path=/path/to/model
