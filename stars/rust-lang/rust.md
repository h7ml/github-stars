This is the main source code repository for Rust. It contains the compiler, standard library, and documentation.

Why Rust?
---------

-   **Performance:** Fast and memory-efficient, suitable for critical services, embedded devices, and easily integrated with other languages.
    
-   **Reliability:** Our rich type system and ownership model ensure memory and thread safety, reducing bugs at compile-time.
    
-   **Productivity:** Comprehensive documentation, a compiler committed to providing great diagnostics, and advanced tooling including package manager and build tool (Cargo), auto-formatter (rustfmt), linter (Clippy) and editor support (rust-analyzer).
