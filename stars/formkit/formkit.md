Key features
------------

#### ☝️ Comprehensive package

FormKit is an all-in-one form-authoring framework with input scaffolding (labels, help text, etc.), validation, form UI & styling, error handling, generation, a11y, i18n, and more!

#### 😎 Developer happiness

Forms are everywhere, yet surprisingly tedious to author — well, not anymore. FormKit provides a powerful and flexible API to developers that makes complex form creation a breeze.

#### 🎯 Validation built in

Ridiculously easy validation out-of-the-box to handle 95% of use-cases. Help text, validation rules, and validation messages are simple props. Need more? You can add custom validation rules too.

#### ⚡️ Blazing-fast Performance

FormKit can handle the most demanding forms — wizards, multi-step, deeply nested repeating groups, and more.

#### 🔌 Plugin system

Extend FormKit's functionality or reuse custom inputs, validation rules and messages across projects by tapping into the plugin system. Make your plugin open source to share with others!

#### ✨ Generate forms

Generate an entire form from a JSON-compatible schema. Schema allows you to render complex forms from JSON with conditional rendering, logic, dynamic data, groups, wrappers, HTML elements, and custom components.

#### 🎨 Robust Theming

FormKit works easily alongside your favorite UI frameworks like Bootstrap and utility-class tools like Tailwind. With numerous ways to modify classes and DOM structure, integrating FormKit plays nicely with any frontend.

#### 🌐 Internationalization

FormKit is made for all! Thanks to the FormKit community, FormKit ships with support for many languages. Don't see your language? Contribute one with our locale builder.
