Chatterbox TTS
==============

\_Made with ‚ô•Ô∏è by

We're excited to introduce Chatterbox, Resemble AI's first production-grade open source TTS model. Licensed under MIT, Chatterbox has been benchmarked against leading closed-source systems like ElevenLabs, and is consistently preferred in side-by-side evaluations.

Whether you're working on memes, videos, games, or AI agents, Chatterbox brings your content to life. It's also the first open source TTS model to support **emotion exaggeration control**, a powerful feature that makes your voices stand out. Try it now on our Hugging Face Gradio app.

If you like the model but need to scale or tune it for higher accuracy, check out our competitively priced TTS service (link). It delivers reliable performance with ultra-low latency of sub 200ms‚Äîideal for production use in agents, applications, or interactive media.

Key Details
===========

-   SoTA zeroshot TTS
-   0.5B Llama backbone
-   Unique exaggeration/intensity control
-   Ultra-stable with alignment-informed inference
-   Trained on 0.5M hours of cleaned data
-   Watermarked outputs
-   Easy voice conversion script
-   Outperforms ElevenLabs

Tips
====

-   **General Use (TTS and Voice Agents):**
    
    -   The default settings (`exaggeration=0.5`, `cfg_weight=0.5`) work well for most prompts.
    -   If the reference speaker has a fast speaking style, lowering `cfg_weight` to around `0.3` can improve pacing.
-   **Expressive or Dramatic Speech:**
    
    -   Try lower `cfg_weight` values (e.g. `~0.3`) and increase `exaggeration` to around `0.7` or higher.
    -   Higher `exaggeration` tends to speed up speech; reducing `cfg_weight` helps compensate with slower, more deliberate pacing.

Installation
============

pip install chatterbox-tts

Alternatively, you can install from source:

# conda create -yn chatterbox python=3.11
# conda activate chatterbox

git clone https://github.com/resemble-ai/chatterbox.git
cd chatterbox
pip install -e .

We developed and tested Chatterbox on Python 3.11 on Debain 11 OS; the versions of the dependencies are pinned in `pyproject.toml` to ensure consistency. You can modify the code or dependencies in this installation mode.

Usage
=====

import torchaudio as ta
from chatterbox.tts import ChatterboxTTS

model \= ChatterboxTTS.from\_pretrained(device\="cuda")

text \= "Ezreal and Jinx teamed up with Ahri, Yasuo, and Teemo to take down the enemy's Nexus in an epic late-game pentakill."
wav \= model.generate(text)
ta.save("test-1.wav", wav, model.sr)

\# If you want to synthesize with a different voice, specify the audio prompt
AUDIO\_PROMPT\_PATH \= "YOUR\_FILE.wav"
wav \= model.generate(text, audio\_prompt\_path\=AUDIO\_PROMPT\_PATH)
ta.save("test-2.wav", wav, model.sr)

See `example_tts.py` and `example_vc.py` for more examples.

Supported Lanugage

Built-in PerTh Watermarking for Responsible AI
==============================================

Every audio file generated by Chatterbox includes Resemble AI's Perth (Perceptual Threshold) Watermarker - imperceptible neural watermarks that survive MP3 compression, audio editing, and common manipulations while maintaining nearly 100% detection accuracy.

Watermark extraction
--------------------

You can look for the watermark using the following script.

import perth
import librosa

AUDIO\_PATH \= "YOUR\_FILE.wav"

\# Load the watermarked audio
watermarked\_audio, sr \= librosa.load(AUDIO\_PATH, sr\=None)

\# Initialize watermarker (same as used for embedding)
watermarker \= perth.PerthImplicitWatermarker()

\# Extract watermark
watermark \= watermarker.get\_watermark(watermarked\_audio, sample\_rate\=sr)
print(f"Extracted watermark: {watermark}")
\# Output: 0.0 (no watermark) or 1.0 (watermarked)
