Commit Sage
===========

A powerful CLI tool that helps you generate meaningful commit messages with AI by analyzing your Git changes.

Overview
--------

Commit Sage analyzes the changes in your Git repository and uses AI to generate contextually relevant commit messages. It saves you time and helps maintain a consistent commit history with descriptive messages.

Features
--------

-   Analyzes staged and unstaged changes in your Git repository
-   Generates commit messages based on the actual code changes
-   Supports different types of changes (staged, unstaged, untracked, deleted)
-   Skips submodule changes automatically
-   Works with any Git repository

Requirements
------------

-   Git installed and accessible in your PATH
-   Internet connection for AI service communication (unless using Ollama)
-   Deno 2.x or higher (if compiling from source)

How It Works
------------

1.  Commit Sage detects if you're in a Git repository
2.  It analyzes the changes in your repository (staged, unstaged, etc.)
3.  The changes are processed and sent to an AI service
4.  The AI generates a contextually relevant commit message
5.  The suggested commit message is displayed for you to use

### Error Handling

Commit Sage provides clear error messages for common issues:

-   When no changes are detected
-   When the API key is not set
-   When Git is not installed or the directory is not a Git repository

Installation
------------

### Option 1: Download Prebuilt Binary

You can download the prebuilt binary for your platform from the Releases page on GitHub. Follow these steps:

1.  Visit the Releases page.
2.  Download the appropriate binary for your operating system (e.g., `commit-sage-linux`, `commit-sage-macos`, or `commit-sage-windows.exe`).
3.  Rename the binary to `commit-sage` and place it in a directory included in your `$PATH` (e.g., `~/.local/bin` for Linux/macOS or any directory for Windows).
4.  Ensure the binary is executable (on Linux/macOS, run `chmod u+x commit-sage`).
5.  Run `commit-sage` from your terminal to use the tool.

### Option 2: Compile from Source

Alternatively, you can build from source.

Clone the repository and compile the executable:

git clone https://github.com/AhmedOsman101/commit-sage-cli.git commit-sage

cd commit-sage

# Compiles the executable to your \`~/.local/bin\` directory. Ensure \`~/.local/bin\` is added to your $PATH.
deno task run compile

Note

If you plan to compile the project yourself, make sure you have Deno installed on your system.

Usage
-----

### Basic Usage

Navigate to your Git repository and run `commit-sage` to generate a commit message based on your changes:

### Advanced Usage with git-commit Wrapper

For enhanced functionality, consider using the `git-commit` wrapper script from AhmedOsman101/shellScripts.

This wrapper script extends `commit-sage` with:

-   Conventional commit message support
-   AI-powered commit messages using `commit-sage`
-   Additional Git integration features

To use the wrapper script:

1.  Install it from AhmedOsman101/shellScripts
2.  Run `git-commit --ai` in your repository instead of `commit-sage`

The wrapper script provides a seamless integration between conventional commit formats and AI-generated messages.

Configuration
-------------

The app requires an API key for the AI service it uses. You can set it up in two ways:

### Environment Variables

Add the following to your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`):

export SERVICE\_API\_KEY='your\_api\_key'

Replace `SERVICE` with the appropriate service name and `your_api_key` with your actual API key.

After adding these lines, restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` to apply the changes.

**Export before running**

This method sets the API key for a single run.

SERVICE\_API\_KEY='your\_api\_key' commit-sage

Note

If you're using `ollama` as your provider, you can skip all API key and environment variable setup. Ollama runs locally and requires no authentication or network access.

* * *

The configuration file allows customization of retry behavior, model providers, commit formatting, and default provider usage.

Limitations / Not Yet Implemented
---------------------------------

The following are known limitations in the current version of **commit-sage**, with plans to address them in future updates:

-   **Handle files with spaces in their names**  
    Previously, the program may have failed or behaved unexpectedly when processing files with spaces in their names. This has been resolved.
    
-   **Configuration options not yet implemented**  
    The following options are defined in the schema for forward compatibility, but are currently **non-functional** and will be ignored at runtime:
    
    -   `commit.autoCommit`
    -   `commit.autoPush`
    -   `commit.onlyStagedChanges`
    -   `commit.promptForRefs`

Note

These options can safely remain in your config. They won't cause any errors, but currently have no effect.  
They are included as placeholders for upcoming features that are under active consideration or development.
