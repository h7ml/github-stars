⚠️ If your region supports official cursor payment, please support the official purchase as much as your funds allow, cursor is a good editor.

⚠️ The cost and benefits generated by using this project are the same as the official ones. This project is not cheaper. It just feels less expensive because it is shared by many people. However, the stability and speed are not as good as the official ones.

⚠️ We plan to cooperate with the cursor official in the future to provide support for projects that can promote the progress of world civilization.

⚠️ If you encounter problems, you can try small amount refresh (by shortcut key 'u3o' 'u3d' 'u3t' 'u3h').

⚠️ We cannot guarantee the stable use of the Claude model, but the default model is very stable.

⚠️ After expiration, paying will increase the usage time of the tool, and small amount refresh payment verification will also increase the usage time.
