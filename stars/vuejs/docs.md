This site is built with VitePress and depends on @vue/theme. Site content is written in Markdown format located in `src`. For simple edits, you can directly edit the file on GitHub and generate a Pull Request.

For local development, pnpm is preferred as package manager:

pnpm run dev

This project requires Node.js to be `v18` or higher. And it is recommended to enable corepack:
