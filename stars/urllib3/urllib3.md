==

  

urllib3 is a powerful, _user-friendly_ HTTP client for Python. Much of the Python ecosystem already uses urllib3 and you should too. urllib3 brings many critical features that are missing from the Python standard libraries:

-   Thread safety.
-   Connection pooling.
-   Client-side SSL/TLS verification.
-   File uploads with multipart encoding.
-   Helpers for retrying requests and dealing with HTTP redirects.
-   Support for gzip, deflate, brotli, and zstd encoding.
-   Proxy support for HTTP and SOCKS.
-   100% test coverage.

urllib3 is powerful and easy to use:

\>\>> import urllib3
\>\>> resp \= urllib3.request("GET", "http://httpbin.org/robots.txt")
\>\>> resp.status
200
\>\>> resp.data
b"User-agent: \*\\nDisallow: /deny\\n"
