About the project
-----------------

Gyroflow is an application that can stabilize your video by using motion data from a gyroscope and optionally an accelerometer. Modern cameras record that data internally (GoPro, Sony, Insta360 etc), and this application stabilizes the captured footage precisely by using them. It can also use gyro data from an external source (eg. from Betaflight blackbox).

### Info for cameras not on the list

-   For cameras which do have built-in gyro, please contact us and we will implement support for that camera. Refer to the documentation for information about the gyro logging process.
-   For cameras which don't have built-in gyro, you can use any other device which records gyro data. It may be a phone, an action camera, or an external device like a Betaflight FC, flowshutter, esp-gyrologger (eg. on an AtomS3). You just have to mount it on your main camera.

Installation
------------

### Windows - Microsoft Store or:

-   Download `Gyroflow-windows64.zip` from the Releases page, extract the files somewhere and run `Gyroflow.exe`

#### I want to contribute but I don't know Rust or QML

-   The Rust book is a great way to get started with Rust: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
-   Additional useful resources for Rust: https://quickref.me/rust and https://cheats.rs/
-   For the UI stuff, there's a nice QML book by The Qt Company: https://www.qt.io/product/qt6/qml-book

Development
-----------

### Used languages and technologies

_Gyroflow_ is written in Rust, with UI written in QML. It uses _Qt_, _ffmpeg_, _OpenCV_ and _mdk-sdk_ external dependencies for the main program, but the core library is written in pure Rust without any external dependencies.

OpenCV usage is kept to a minimum, used only for lens calibration and optical flow (`src/core/calibration/mod.rs` and `src/core/synchronization/opencv.rs`). Core algorithms and undistortion don't use OpenCV.

GPU stuff supports _DirectX_, _OpenGL_, _Metal_ and _Vulkan_ thanks to _Qt RHI_ and _wgpu_. For GPU processing we use _OpenCL_ or _wgpu_, with highly parallelized CPU implementation as a fallback.

### Code structure

1.  Entire GUI is in the `src/ui` directory
2.  `src/controller.rs` is a bridge between UI and core, it takes all commands from QML and calls functions in core
3.  `src/core` contains the whole gyroflow engine and doesn't depend on _Qt_ or _ffmpeg_. _OpenCV_ is optional
4.  `src/rendering` contains all FFmpeg related code for rendering final video and processing for synchronization
5.  `src/core/gpu` contains GPU implementations of the undistortion
6.  `src/qt_gpu` contains zero-copy GPU undistortion path, using Qt RHI and GLSL compute shader
7.  `src/gyroflow.rs` is the main entry point
8.  `mod.rs` or `lib.rs` in each directory act as a main entry of the module (directory name is the module name and `mod.rs` is kind of an entry point)

### Dev environment

`Visual Studio Code` with `rust-analyzer` extension.

For working with QML I recommend to use Qt Creator and load all QML files there, as it has auto-complete and syntax highlighting. The project also supports UI live reload, it's a super quick way of working with the UI. Just change `live_reload = true` in `gyroflow.rs` and it should work right away. Now every time you change any QML file, the app should reload it immediately.
