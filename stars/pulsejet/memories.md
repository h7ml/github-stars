🏗 Development Setup
--------------------

You can use the dev container to quickly fire up an instance of Nextcloud with Memories pre-installed. See `.devcontainer/README.md` for more information.

To set up a development instance manually, follow these steps:

1.  ☁ Clone this monorepo into the `custom_apps` folder of your Nextcloud.
2.  📥 Install Composer and Node.js 18
3.  👩‍💻 In a terminal, run the command `make dev-setup` to install the dependencies.
4.  🏗 To build/watch the UI, run `make watch-js`.
5.  ✅ Enable the app through the app management of your Nextcloud.
6.  ⚒️ (Strongly recommended) use VS Code for development and install these extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+P` > `Show Recommended Extensions`).
    -   PHP Intelephense: For PHP intellisense and static analysis
    -   PHP-CS-Fixer: For PHP formatting (alternatively, `make php-cs-fixer`)
    -   Psalm: For PHP static analysis (alternatively, `make psalm`)
    -   Prettier: For autoformatting Vue and Typescript
    -   Volar: For Vue intellisense and static analysis
7.  If using PHP Intelephense, search for `@builtin php-language-features` in the extensions tab and disable it.

This monorepo is organized into the following packages:

-   lib: Backend and database migrations (PHP).
-   src: Frontend for all platforms (Vue)
-   go-vod: On-demand video transcoder (Go)
