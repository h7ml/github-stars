tRPC
====

### Move fast and break nothing.  
End-to-end typesafe APIs made easy.

  
  
  

The client above is **not** importing any code from the server, only its type declarations.

  

Intro
-----

tRPC allows you to easily build & consume fully typesafe APIs without schemas or code generation.

### Features

-   ✅  Well-tested and production ready.
-   🧙‍♂️  Full static typesafety & autocompletion on the client, for inputs, outputs, and errors.
-   🐎  Snappy DX - No code generation, run-time bloat, or build pipeline.
-   🍃  Light - tRPC has zero deps and a tiny client-side footprint.
-   🐻  Easy to add to your existing brownfield project.
-   🔋  Batteries included - React.js/Next.js/Express.js/Fastify adapters. _(But tRPC is not tied to React, and there are many community adapters for other libraries)_
-   🥃  Subscriptions support.
-   ⚡️  Request batching - requests made at the same time can be automatically combined into one
-   👀  Quite a few examples in the ./examples\-folder

Quickstart
----------

There are a few examples that you can use for playing out with tRPC or bootstrapping your new project. For example, if you want a Next.js app, you can use the full-stack Next.js example:

**Quick start with a full-stack Next.js example:**

# yarn
yarn create next-app --example https://github.com/trpc/trpc --example-path examples/next-prisma-starter trpc-prisma-starter

# npm
npx create-next-app --example https://github.com/trpc/trpc --example-path examples/next-prisma-starter trpc-prisma-starter

# pnpm
