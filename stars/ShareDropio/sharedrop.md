ShareDrop is now LimeWire
=========================

Dear ShareDrop community, ShareDrop has been acquired by LimeWire, a leading file sharing platform with integrated AI tools. You can continue to share any files between devices, while benefitting from:

-   sharing files between devices in the same network
-   anonymous up- & downloads
-   end-to-end encryption
-   up to 40GB storage for free users
-   integrated AI tools for signed-up users

Visit sharedrop.io or limewire.com

The Github repository will stay as-is and you can still go ahead and download and run the classic ShareDrop on your own infrastructure.

ShareDrop Classic
=================

ShareDrop is a web application inspired by Apple AirDrop service. It allows you to transfer files directly between devices, without having to upload them to any server first. It uses WebRTC for secure peer-to-peer file transfer and Firebase for presence management and WebRTC signaling.

ShareDrop allows you to send files to other devices in the same local network (i.e. devices with the same public IP address) without any configuration - simply open https://www.sharedrop.io on all devices and they will see each other. It also allows you to send files between networks - just click the `+` button in the top right corner of the page to create a room with a unique URL and share this URL with other people you want to send a file to. Once they open this page in a browser on their devices, you'll see each other's avatars.

The main difference between ShareDrop and AirDrop is that ShareDrop requires Internet connection to discover other devices, while AirDrop doesn't need one, as it creates ad-hoc wireless network between them. On the other hand, ShareDrop allows you to share files between mobile (Android and iOS) and desktop devices and even between networks.

Supported browsers
------------------

-   Chrome
-   Edge (Chromium based)
-   Firefox
-   Opera
-   Safari 13+

Local development
-----------------

1.  Setup Firebase:
    1.  Sign up for a Firebase account and create a database.
    2.  Go to "Security Rules" tab, click "Load Rules" button and select `firebase_rules.json` file.
    3.  Take note of your database URL and its secret, which can be found in "Secrets" tab.
2.  Run `npm install -g ember-cli` to install Ember CLI.
3.  Run `yarn` to install app dependencies.
4.  Run `cp .env{.sample,}` to create `.env` file. This file will be used by Foreman to set environment variables when running the app locally.
    -   `SECRET` key is used to encrypt cookies and generate room name based on public IP address for `/` route. It can be any random string - you can generate one using e.g. `date | md5sum`
    -   `NEW_RELIC_*` keys are only necessary in production
5.  Run `yarn develop` to start the app.
