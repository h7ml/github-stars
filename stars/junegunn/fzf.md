fzf is a general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder.

It's an interactive filter program for any kind of list; files, command history, processes, hostnames, bookmarks, git commits, etc. It implements a "fuzzy" matching algorithm, so you can quickly type in patterns with omitted characters and still get the results you want.

Zypper

openSUSE

`sudo zypper install fzf`

Important

To set up shell integration (key bindings and fuzzy completion), see the instructions below.

### Windows packages

On Windows, fzf is available via Chocolatey, Scoop, Winget, and MSYS2:

Package manager

Command

Chocolatey

`choco install fzf`

Scoop

`scoop install fzf`

Winget

`winget install fzf`

MSYS2 (pacman)

`pacman -S $MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX-fzf`

### Using git

Alternatively, you can "git clone" this repository to any directory and run install script.

git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.git ~/.fzf
~/.fzf/install

The install script will add lines to your shell configuration file to modify `$PATH` and set up shell integration.

### Binary releases

You can download the official fzf binaries from the releases page.

-   https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/releases

### Setting up shell integration

Add the following line to your shell configuration file.

-   bash
    
    # Set up fzf key bindings and fuzzy completion
    eval "$(fzf --bash)"
    
-   zsh
    
    # Set up fzf key bindings and fuzzy completion
    source <(fzf --zsh)
    
-   fish
    
    # Set up fzf key bindings
    fzf \--fish | source
    

Note

`--bash`, `--zsh`, and `--fish` options are only available in fzf 0.48.0 or later. If you have an older version of fzf, or want finer control, you can source individual script files in the /shell directory. The location of the files may vary depending on the package manager you use. Please refer to the package documentation for more information. (e.g. `apt show fzf`)

Tip

You can disable CTRL-T or ALT-C binding by setting `FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND` or `FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND` to an empty string when sourcing the script. For example, to disable ALT-C binding:

-   bash: `FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND= eval "$(fzf --bash)"`
-   zsh: `FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND= source <(fzf --zsh)`
-   fish: `fzf --fish | FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND= source`

Setting the variables after sourcing the script will have no effect.

### Vim/Neovim plugin

If you use vim-plug, add this to your Vim configuration file:

Plug 'junegunn/fzf', { 'do': { \-\> fzf#install() } }
Plug 'junegunn/fzf.vim'

-   `junegunn/fzf` provides the basic library functions
    -   `fzf#install()` makes sure that you have the latest binary
-   `junegunn/fzf.vim` is a separate project that provides a variety of useful commands

To learn more about the Vim integration, see README-VIM.md.

Tip

If you use Neovim and prefer Lua-based plugins, check out fzf-lua.

Upgrading fzf
-------------

fzf is being actively developed, and you might want to upgrade it once in a while. Please follow the instruction below depending on the installation method used.

-   git: `cd ~/.fzf && git pull && ./install`
-   brew: `brew update; brew upgrade fzf`
-   macports: `sudo port upgrade fzf`
-   chocolatey: `choco upgrade fzf`
-   vim-plug: `:PlugUpdate fzf`

Building fzf
------------

See BUILD.md.

Usage
-----

fzf will launch interactive finder, read the list from STDIN, and write the selected item to STDOUT.

find \* -type f | fzf \> selected

Without STDIN pipe, fzf will traverse the file system under the current directory to get the list of files.

vim $(fzf)

Note

You can override the default behavior

-   Either by setting `$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND` to a command that generates the desired list
-   Or by setting `--walker`, `--walker-root`, and `--walker-skip` options in `$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS`

Warning

A more robust solution would be to use `xargs` but we've presented the above as it's easier to grasp

fzf --print0 | xargs -0 -o vim

Tip

fzf also has the ability to turn itself into a different process.

fzf --bind 'enter:become(vim {})'

_See Turning into a different process for more information._

### Using the finder

-   `CTRL-K` / `CTRL-J` (or `CTRL-P` / `CTRL-N`) to move cursor up and down
-   `Enter` key to select the item, `CTRL-C` / `CTRL-G` / `ESC` to exit
-   On multi-select mode (`-m`), `TAB` and `Shift-TAB` to mark multiple items
-   Emacs style key bindings
-   Mouse: scroll, click, double-click; shift-click and shift-scroll on multi-select mode

### Display modes

fzf by default runs in fullscreen mode, but there are other display modes.

#### `--height` mode

With `--height HEIGHT[%]`, fzf will start below the cursor with the given height.

fzf --height 40%

`reverse` layout and `--border` goes well with this option.

fzf --height 40% --layout reverse --border

By prepending `~` to the height, you're setting the maximum height.

# Will take as few lines as possible to display the list
seq 3 | fzf --height ~100%
seq 3000 | fzf --height ~100%

Height value can be a negative number.

# Screen height - 3
fzf --height -3

#### `--tmux` mode

With `--tmux` option, fzf will start in a tmux popup.

# --tmux \[center|top|bottom|left|right\]\[,SIZE\[%\]\]\[,SIZE\[%\]\[,border-native\]\]

fzf --tmux center         # Center, 50% width and height
fzf --tmux 80%            # Center, 80% width and height
fzf --tmux 100%,50%       # Center, 100% width and 50% height
fzf --tmux left,40%       # Left, 40% width
fzf --tmux left,40%,90%   # Left, 40% width, 90% height
fzf --tmux top,40%        # Top, 40% height
fzf --tmux bottom,80%,40% # Bottom, 80% height, 40% height

`--tmux` is silently ignored when you're not on tmux.

Note

If you're stuck with an old version of tmux that doesn't support popup, or if you want to open fzf in a regular tmux pane, check out fzf-tmux script.

Tip

You can add these options to `$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS` so that they're applied by default. For example,

# Open in tmux popup if on tmux, otherwise use --height mode
export FZF\_DEFAULT\_OPTS='\--height 40% --tmux bottom,40% --layout reverse --border top'

### Search syntax

Unless otherwise specified, fzf starts in "extended-search mode" where you can type in multiple search terms delimited by spaces. e.g. `^music .mp3$ sbtrkt !fire`

Token

Match type

Description

`sbtrkt`

fuzzy-match

Items that match `sbtrkt`

`'wild`

exact-match (quoted)

Items that include `wild`

`'wild'`

exact-boundary-match (quoted both ends)

Items that include `wild` at word boundaries

`^music`

prefix-exact-match

Items that start with `music`

`.mp3$`

suffix-exact-match

Items that end with `.mp3`

`!fire`

inverse-exact-match

Items that do not include `fire`

`!^music`

inverse-prefix-exact-match

Items that do not start with `music`

`!.mp3$`

inverse-suffix-exact-match

Items that do not end with `.mp3`

If you don't prefer fuzzy matching and do not wish to "quote" every word, start fzf with `-e` or `--exact` option. Note that when `--exact` is set, `'`\-prefix "unquotes" the term.

A single bar character term acts as an OR operator. For example, the following query matches entries that start with `core` and end with either `go`, `rb`, or `py`.

```
^core go$ | rb$ | py$
```

### Environment variables

-   `FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND`
    -   Default command to use when input is tty
    -   e.g. `export FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND='fd --type f'`
-   `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS`
    -   Default options
    -   e.g. `export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS="--layout=reverse --inline-info"`
-   `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS_FILE`
    -   If you prefer to manage default options in a file, set this variable to point to the location of the file
    -   e.g. `export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS_FILE=~/.fzfrc`

Warning

`FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND` is not used by shell integration due to the slight difference in requirements.

-   `CTRL-T` runs `$FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND` to get a list of files and directories
-   `ALT-C` runs `$FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND` to get a list of directories
-   `vim ~/**<tab>` runs `fzf_compgen_path()` with the prefix (`~/`) as the first argument
-   `cd foo**<tab>` runs `fzf_compgen_dir()` with the prefix (`foo`) as the first argument

The available options are described later in this document.

### Customizing the look

The user interface of fzf is fully customizable with a large number of configuration options. For a quick setup, you can start with one of the style presets ‚Äî `default`, `full`, or `minimal` ‚Äî using the `--style` option.

fzf --style full \\
    --preview 'fzf-preview.sh {}' --bind 'focus:transform-header:file --brief {}'

Preset

Screenshot

`default`

`full`

`minimal`

Here's an example based on the `full` preset:

git ls-files | fzf --style full \\
    --border --padding 1,2 \\
    --border-label ' Demo ' --input-label ' Input ' --header-label ' File Type ' \\
    --preview 'fzf-preview.sh {}' \\
    --bind 'result:transform-list-label:
        if \[\[ -z $FZF\_QUERY \]\]; then
          echo " $FZF\_MATCH\_COUNT items "
        else
          echo " $FZF\_MATCH\_COUNT matches for \[$FZF\_QUERY\] "
        fi
        ' \\
    --bind 'focus:transform-preview-label:\[\[ -n {} \]\] && printf " Previewing \[%s\] " {}' \\
    --bind 'focus:+transform-header:file --brief {} || echo "No file selected"' \\
    --bind 'ctrl-r:change-list-label( Reloading the list )+reload(sleep 2; git ls-files)' \\
    --color 'border:#aaaaaa,label:#cccccc' \\
    --color 'preview-border:#9999cc,preview-label:#ccccff' \\
    --color 'list-border:#669966,list-label:#99cc99' \\
    --color 'input-border:#996666,input-label:#ffcccc' \\
    --color 'header-border:#6699cc,header-label:#99ccff'

### Options

See the man page (`fzf --man` or `man fzf`) for the full list of options.

Key bindings for command-line
-----------------------------

By setting up shell integration, you can use the following key bindings in bash, zsh, and fish.

-   `CTRL-T` - Paste the selected files and directories onto the command-line
    -   The list is generated using `--walker file,dir,follow,hidden` option
        -   You can override the behavior by setting `FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND` to a custom command that generates the desired list
        -   Or you can set `--walker*` options in `FZF_CTRL_T_OPTS`
    -   Set `FZF_CTRL_T_OPTS` to pass additional options to fzf
        
        # Preview file content using bat (https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
        export FZF\_CTRL\_T\_OPTS="
          --walker-skip .git,node\_modules,target
          --preview 'bat -n --color=always {}'
          --bind 'ctrl-/:change-preview-window(down|hidden|)'"
        
    -   Can be disabled by setting `FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND` to an empty string when sourcing the script
-   `CTRL-R` - Paste the selected command from history onto the command-line
    -   If you want to see the commands in chronological order, press `CTRL-R` again which toggles sorting by relevance
    -   Press `CTRL-/` or `ALT-/` to toggle line wrapping
    -   Set `FZF_CTRL_R_OPTS` to pass additional options to fzf
        
        # CTRL-Y to copy the command into clipboard using pbcopy
        export FZF\_CTRL\_R\_OPTS="
          --bind 'ctrl-y:execute-silent(echo -n {2..} | pbcopy)+abort'
          --color header:italic
          --header 'Press CTRL-Y to copy command into clipboard'"
        
-   `ALT-C` - cd into the selected directory
    -   The list is generated using `--walker dir,follow,hidden` option
    -   Set `FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND` to override the default command
        -   Or you can set `--walker-*` options in `FZF_ALT_C_OPTS`
    -   Set `FZF_ALT_C_OPTS` to pass additional options to fzf
        
        # Print tree structure in the preview window
        export FZF\_ALT\_C\_OPTS="
          --walker-skip .git,node\_modules,target
          --preview 'tree -C {}'"
        
    -   Can be disabled by setting `FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND` to an empty string when sourcing the script

Display modes for these bindings can be separately configured via `FZF_{CTRL_T,CTRL_R,ALT_C}_OPTS` or globally via `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS`. (e.g. `FZF_CTRL_R_OPTS='--tmux bottom,60% --height 60% --border top'`)

More tips can be found on the wiki page.

Fuzzy completion for bash and zsh
---------------------------------

### Files and directories

Fuzzy completion for files and directories can be triggered if the word before the cursor ends with the trigger sequence, which is by default `**`.

-   `COMMAND [DIRECTORY/][FUZZY_PATTERN]**<TAB>`

# Files under the current directory
# - You can select multiple items with TAB key
vim \*\*<TAB\>

# Files under parent directory
vim ../\*\*<TAB\>

# Files under parent directory that match \`fzf\`
vim ../fzf\*\*<TAB\>

# Files under your home directory
vim ~/\*\*<TAB\>

# Directories under current directory (single-selection)
cd \*\*<TAB\>

# Directories under ~/github that match \`fzf\`
cd ~/github/fzf\*\*<TAB\>

### Process IDs

Fuzzy completion for PIDs is provided for kill command.

# Can select multiple processes with <TAB> or <Shift-TAB> keys
kill -9 \*\*<TAB\>

### Host names

For ssh and telnet commands, fuzzy completion for hostnames is provided. The names are extracted from /etc/hosts and ~/.ssh/config.

ssh \*\*<TAB\>
telnet \*\*<TAB\>

### Environment variables / Aliases

unset \*\*<TAB\>
export \*\*<TAB\>
unalias \*\*<TAB\>

### Customizing fzf options for completion

# Use ~~ as the trigger sequence instead of the default \*\*
export FZF\_COMPLETION\_TRIGGER='~~'

# Options to fzf command
export FZF\_COMPLETION\_OPTS='\--border --info=inline'

# Options for path completion (e.g. vim \*\*<TAB>)
export FZF\_COMPLETION\_PATH\_OPTS='\--walker file,dir,follow,hidden'

# Options for directory completion (e.g. cd \*\*<TAB>)
export FZF\_COMPLETION\_DIR\_OPTS='\--walker dir,follow'

# Advanced customization of fzf options via \_fzf\_comprun function
# - The first argument to the function is the name of the command.
# - You should make sure to pass the rest of the arguments ($@) to fzf.
\_fzf\_comprun() {
  local command=$1
  shift

  case "$command" in
    cd)           fzf --preview 'tree -C {} | head -200'   "$@" ;;
    export|unset) fzf --preview "eval 'echo \\$'{}"         "$@" ;;
    ssh)          fzf --preview 'dig {}'                   "$@" ;;
    \*)            fzf --preview 'bat -n --color=always {}' "$@" ;;
  esac
}

### Customizing completion source for paths and directories

# Use fd (https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) for listing path candidates.
# - The first argument to the function ($1) is the base path to start traversal
# - See the source code (completion.{bash,zsh}) for the details.
\_fzf\_compgen\_path() {
  fd --hidden --follow --exclude ".git" . "$1"
}

# Use fd to generate the list for directory completion
\_fzf\_compgen\_dir() {
  fd --type d --hidden --follow --exclude ".git" . "$1"
}

### Supported commands

On bash, fuzzy completion is enabled only for a predefined set of commands (`complete | grep _fzf` to see the list). But you can enable it for other commands as well by using `_fzf_setup_completion` helper function.

# usage: \_fzf\_setup\_completion path|dir|var|alias|host COMMANDS...
\_fzf\_setup\_completion path ag git kubectl
\_fzf\_setup\_completion dir tree

### Custom fuzzy completion

_**(Custom completion API is experimental and subject to change)**_

For a command named _"COMMAND"_, define `_fzf_complete_COMMAND` function using `_fzf_complete` helper.

# Custom fuzzy completion for "doge" command
#   e.g. doge \*\*<TAB>
\_fzf\_complete\_doge() {
  \_fzf\_complete --multi --reverse --prompt="doge> " -- "$@" < <(
    echo very
    echo wow
    echo such
    echo doge
  )
}

-   The arguments before `--` are the options to fzf.
-   After `--`, simply pass the original completion arguments unchanged (`"$@"`).
-   Then, write a set of commands that generates the completion candidates and feed its output to the function using process substitution (`< <(...)`).

zsh will automatically pick up the function using the naming convention but in bash you have to manually associate the function with the command using the `complete` command.

\[ \-n "$BASH" \] && complete -F \_fzf\_complete\_doge -o default -o bashdefault doge

If you need to post-process the output from fzf, define `_fzf_complete_COMMAND_post` as follows.

\_fzf\_complete\_foo() {
  \_fzf\_complete --multi --reverse --header-lines=3 -- "$@" < <(
    ls -al
  )
}

\_fzf\_complete\_foo\_post() {
  awk '{print $NF}'
}

\[ \-n "$BASH" \] && complete -F \_fzf\_complete\_foo -o default -o bashdefault foo

Advanced topics

### Customizing for different types of input

Since fzf is a general-purpose text filter, its algorithm was designed to "generally" work well with any kind of input. However, admittedly, there is no true one-size-fits-all solution, and you may want to tweak the algorithm and some of the settings depending on the type of the input. To make this process easier, fzf provides a set of "scheme"s for some common input types.

Scheme

Description

`--scheme=default`

Generic scheme designed to work well with any kind of input

`--scheme=path`

Suitable for file paths

`--scheme=history`

Suitable for command history or any input where chronological ordering is important

(See `fzf --man` for the details)

### Performance

fzf is fast. Performance should not be a problem in most use cases. However, you might want to be aware of the options that can affect performance.

-   `--ansi` tells fzf to extract and parse ANSI color codes in the input, and it makes the initial scanning slower. So it's not recommended that you add it to your `$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS`.
-   `--nth` makes fzf slower because it has to tokenize each line.
-   A plain string `--delimiter` should be preferred over a regular expression delimiter.
-   `--with-nth` makes fzf slower as fzf has to tokenize and reassemble each line.

### Executing external programs

You can set up key bindings for starting external processes without leaving fzf (`execute`, `execute-silent`).

# Press F1 to open the file with less without leaving fzf
# Press CTRL-Y to copy the line to clipboard and aborts fzf (requires pbcopy)
fzf --bind 'f1:execute(less -f {}),ctrl-y:execute-silent(echo {} | pbcopy)+abort'

See _KEY/EVENT BINDINGS_ section of the man page for details.

### Turning into a different process

`become(...)` is similar to `execute(...)`/`execute-silent(...)` described above, but instead of executing the command and coming back to fzf on complete, it turns fzf into a new process for the command.

fzf --bind 'enter:become(vim {})'

Compared to the seemingly equivalent command substitution `vim "$(fzf)"`, this approach has several advantages:

-   Vim will not open an empty file when you terminate fzf with CTRL-C
-   Vim will not open an empty file when you press ENTER on an empty result
-   Can handle multiple selections even when they have whitespaces
    
    fzf --multi --bind 'enter:become(vim {+})'
    

To be fair, running `fzf --print0 | xargs -0 -o vim` instead of `vim "$(fzf)"` resolves all of the issues mentioned. Nonetheless, `become(...)` still offers additional benefits in different scenarios.

-   You can set up multiple bindings to handle the result in different ways without any wrapping script
    
    fzf --bind 'enter:become(vim {}),ctrl-e:become(emacs {})'
    
    -   Previously, you would have to use `--expect=ctrl-e` and check the first line of the output of fzf
-   You can easily build the subsequent command using the field index expressions of fzf
    
    # Open the file in Vim and go to the line
    git grep --line-number . |
        fzf --delimiter : --nth 3.. --bind 'enter:become(vim {1} +{2})'
    

### Reloading the candidate list

By binding `reload` action to a key or an event, you can make fzf dynamically reload the candidate list. See #1750 for more details.

#### 1\. Update the list of processes by pressing CTRL-R

ps -ef |
  fzf --bind 'ctrl-r:reload(ps -ef)' \\
      --header 'Press CTRL-R to reload' --header-lines=1 \\
      --height=50% --layout=reverse

#### 2\. Switch between sources by pressing CTRL-D or CTRL-F

FZF\_DEFAULT\_COMMAND='find . -type f' \\
  fzf --bind 'ctrl-d:reload(find . -type d),ctrl-f:reload(eval "$FZF\_DEFAULT\_COMMAND")' \\
      --height=50% --layout=reverse

#### 3\. Interactive ripgrep integration

The following example uses fzf as the selector interface for ripgrep. We bound `reload` action to `change` event, so every time you type on fzf, the ripgrep process will restart with the updated query string denoted by the placeholder expression `{q}`. Also, note that we used `--disabled` option so that fzf doesn't perform any secondary filtering.

: | rg\_prefix='rg --column --line-number --no-heading --color=always --smart-case' \\
    fzf --bind 'start:reload:$rg\_prefix ""' \\
        --bind 'change:reload:$rg\_prefix {q} || true' \\
        --bind 'enter:become(vim {1} +{2})' \\
        --ansi --disabled \\
        --height=50% --layout=reverse

If ripgrep doesn't find any matches, it will exit with a non-zero exit status, and fzf will warn you about it. To suppress the warning message, we added `|| true` to the command, so that it always exits with 0.

See "Using fzf as interactive Ripgrep launcher" for more sophisticated examples.

### Preview window

When the `--preview` option is set, fzf automatically starts an external process with the current line as the argument and shows the result in the split window. Your `$SHELL` is used to execute the command with `$SHELL -c COMMAND`. The window can be scrolled using the mouse or custom key bindings.

# {} is replaced with the single-quoted string of the focused line
fzf --preview 'cat {}'

Preview window supports ANSI colors, so you can use any program that syntax-highlights the content of a file, such as Bat or Highlight:

fzf --preview 'bat --color=always {}' --preview-window '~3'

You can customize the size, position, and border of the preview window using `--preview-window` option, and the foreground and background color of it with `--color` option. For example,

fzf --height 40% --layout reverse --info inline --border \\
    --preview 'file {}' --preview-window up,1,border-horizontal \\
    --bind 'ctrl-/:change-preview-window(50%|hidden|)' \\
    --color 'fg:#bbccdd,fg+:#ddeeff,bg:#334455,preview-bg:#223344,border:#778899'

See the man page (`man fzf`) for the full list of options.

More advanced examples can be found here.

Warning

Since fzf is a general-purpose text filter rather than a file finder, **it is not a good idea to add `--preview` option to your `$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS`**.

# \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
# \*\* DO NOT DO THIS! \*\*
# \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
export FZF\_DEFAULT\_OPTS='\--preview "bat --style=numbers --color=always --line-range :500 {}"'

# bat doesn't work with any input other than the list of files
ps -ef | fzf
seq 100 | fzf
history | fzf

### Previewing an image

fzf can display images in the preview window using one of the following protocols:

-   Kitty graphics protocol
-   iTerm2 inline images protocol
-   Sixel

See bin/fzf-preview.sh script for more information.

fzf --preview 'fzf-preview.sh {}'

Tips
----

### Respecting `.gitignore`

You can use fd, ripgrep, or the silver searcher to traverse the file system while respecting `.gitignore`.

# Feed the output of fd into fzf
fd --type f --strip-cwd-prefix | fzf

# Setting fd as the default source for fzf
export FZF\_DEFAULT\_COMMAND='fd --type f --strip-cwd-prefix'

# Now fzf (w/o pipe) will use the fd command to generate the list
fzf

# To apply the command to CTRL-T as well
export FZF\_CTRL\_T\_COMMAND="$FZF\_DEFAULT\_COMMAND"

If you want the command to follow symbolic links and don't want it to exclude hidden files, use the following command:

export FZF\_DEFAULT\_COMMAND='fd --type f --strip-cwd-prefix --hidden --follow --exclude .git'

### Fish shell

`CTRL-T` key binding of fish, unlike those of bash and zsh, will use the last token on the command-line as the root directory for the recursive search. For instance, hitting `CTRL-T` at the end of the following command-line

ls /var/

will list all files and directories under `/var/`.

When using a custom `FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND`, use the unexpanded `$dir` variable to make use of this feature. `$dir` defaults to `.` when the last token is not a valid directory. Example:

set -g FZF\_CTRL\_T\_COMMAND "command find -L \\$dir -type f 2> /dev/null | sed '1d; s#^\\./##'"
