🖥️ Compatibility

-   `Zen Twilight` - Is currently built using Firefox version `RC 136.0`!
-   Check out the latest release notes!
-   Part of our mission is to keep Zen up-to-date with the latest version of Firefox, so you can enjoy the latest features and security updates!

🤝 Contribution
---------------

Zen is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from the community! Please take a look at the contribution guidelines before getting started!

### Issue metrics

We keep track of how many issues are closed at the end of the month in docs/issue-metrics. We use this to keep track of our issues and see our progress! 📈

### Versioning

Zen uses Semantic Versioning, meaning versions are displayed as `a.b.cd` where:

-   `a` is the major version
-   `b` is the minor version
-   `c` is the branch prefix
-   `d` is the patch version

### Branches

Zen is divided into 2 main branches. We use `dev` for development and `stable` for stable releases. The `dev` branch is where all the new features are added and where `twilight` builds are generated. The `stable` branch is where the stable releases are generated.

We divide into 2 branches in case there's any really important security update (for example) that needs to be released before the next stable release. This allows us to do patches without releasing unstable versions to the public.

⚡ Performance
-------------

Zen is built with performance in mind, and we have optimized the browser to be as fast as possible! Checkout the latest performance benchmarks!
