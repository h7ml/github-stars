About the Project
=================

Coolify is an open-source & self-hostable alternative to Heroku / Netlify / Vercel / etc.

It helps you manage your servers, applications, and databases on your own hardware; you only need an SSH connection. You can manage VPS, Bare Metal, Raspberry PIs, and anything else.

Imagine having the ease of a cloud but with your own servers. That is **Coolify**.

No vendor lock-in, which means that all the configurations for your applications/databases/etc are saved to your server. So, if you decide to stop using Coolify (oh nooo), you could still manage your running resources. You lose the automations and all the magic. ü™ÑÔ∏è

For more information, take a look at our landing page at coolify.io.

Cloud
=====

If you do not want to self-host Coolify, there is a paid cloud version available: app.coolify.io

For more information & pricing, take a look at our landing page coolify.io.

Why should I use the Cloud version?
-----------------------------------

The recommended way to use Coolify is to have one server for Coolify and one (or more) for the resources you are deploying. A server is around 4-5$/month.

By subscribing to the cloud version, you get the Coolify server for the same price, but with:

-   High-availability
-   Free email notifications
-   Better support
-   Less maintenance for you
