Install using npm:

Then import in your project:

import \* as FilePond from 'filepond';

// Create a multi file upload component
const pond \= FilePond.create({
    multiple: true,
    name: 'filepond',
});

// Add it to the DOM
document.body.appendChild(pond.element);

Or get it from a CDN:

<!DOCTYPE html\>
<html\>
    <head\>
        <title\>FilePond from CDN</title\>

        <!-- Filepond stylesheet -->
        <link href\="https://unpkg.com/filepond/dist/filepond.css" rel\="stylesheet" />
    </head\>
    <body\>
        <!-- We'll transform this input into a pond -->
        <input type\="file" class\="filepond" />

        <!-- Load FilePond library -->
        <script src\="https://unpkg.com/filepond/dist/filepond.js"\></script\>

        <!-- Turn all file input elements into ponds -->
        <script\>
            FilePond.parse(document.body);
        </script\>
    </body\>
</html\>
