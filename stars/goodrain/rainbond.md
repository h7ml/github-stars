What is Rainbond?
-----------------

Rainbond is a Kubernetes-based cloud-native application management platform that is 100% open-source. It is dedicated to transforming complex container orchestration and application management capabilities into a simple and user-friendly development and operations experience. Without needing in-depth knowledge of Kubernetes' underlying architecture, users can achieve full lifecycle management of applications through a graphical interface and standardized workflows. Ideal for enterprises to quickly build cloud-native application platforms, it reduces technical barriers and implementation costs.

Why Rainbond?
-------------

### Positioning Differences with Mainstream Platforms

**Platform Type**

Representative Products

Rainbond's Differentiation

**Developer-friendly PaaS**

Heroku, Vercel

â–¶ Self-hosted Support â–¶ Full K8s Compatibility

**K8s Native Tools**

Rancher, Devtron

â–¶ Application-level Abstraction â–¶ Zero YAML Experience â–¶ Complex Application Topology â–¶ Offline Environment Support

**Self-hosted Solutions**

CapRover, Coolify

â–¶ Enterprise Multi-tenancy â–¶ Hybrid Cloud Management

### ðŸŽ¯ What Pain Points Does It Solve?

**Developer Perspective**

-   "I need to deploy a system with 20 microservices, but don't want to study K8s configs for each component"
-   "The configuration differences between production and test environments make every deployment risky"
-   "How to quickly deliver complex systems in customer's offline environment?"

**Ops/Platform Admin Perspective**

-   "Need to give developers autonomy while ensuring cluster stability"
-   "Traditional application cloud-native transformation costs too much"
-   "Unified application management across multi/hybrid cloud environments"

### ðŸš€ Core Capabilities

-   **Install Enterprise Software Like Mobile Apps**: Through the built-in application marketplace, various published microservice application templates support one-click installation and upgrades, even for systems with 100+ microservices.
    
-   **Containerization Without Dockerfile and YAML**: The platform automatically recognizes multiple development languages like Java, Python, Golang, NodeJS, PHP, .NetCore, etc., completing build and deployment through a wizard-like process without writing Dockerfile or YAML.
    
-   **Full Application Lifecycle Management**: Serverless experience where regular developers can manage and maintain applications and components without learning, including start, stop, build, update, auto-scaling, gateway policy management, etc., with non-invasive microservice architecture.
    
-   **Microservice Modular Assembly**: Business components running on Rainbond support modular dependency orchestration, one-click publishing as reusable application templates, enabling business component accumulation and reuse.
    

### Who Is It Designed For?

ðŸ‘©ðŸ’» Developer Users

-   Need URL access within 5 minutes from code
-   Want cloud-native capabilities without learning K8s
-   Zero configuration differences between dev and prod environments

ðŸ‘¨ðŸ’¼ Platform Managers

-   Traditional application cloud-native transformation
-   Building internal PaaS platforms
-   Achieving unified hybrid cloud management

### âœ¨ Differentiating Highlights Comparison

Dimension

Traditional Approach

Rainbond Approach

**Deployment Complexity**

Requires K8s experts to write YAML

Visual orchestration, auto-generates K8s resources

**Environment Consistency**

Manual maintenance of multiple configs

Environment config templating, one-click deployment

**Delivery Form**

Docs + scripts + manual deployment

Self-contained app template (code + config)

**Skill Requirements**

Need full container/K8s stack skills

Operation interface based on application model abstraction

Getting Started
---------------

Installation
------------

### Minimum Requirements

-   Linux OS (CentOS 7+/Ubuntu 18.04+)
-   2 CPU cores / 8GB RAM / 50GB disk space

### 3-Minute Quick Installation
