Usage & Documentation
---------------------

Keystone 6 is published to npm under the `@keystone-6/*` namespace.

You can find our extended documentation on our website, but some quick links that might be helpful:

-   Read Why Keystone to learn about our vision and what's in the box.
-   Getting Started walks you through first steps with the `create-keystone-app` CLI.
-   Our Examples contain a growing collection of projects you can run locally to learn more about a Keystone feature.
-   An API Reference contains the details on Keystone's foundational building blocks.
-   Some Guides offer practical walkthroughs on how to build with those blocks.

> üí° While our `API Reference` is generally complete, we are are still working hard on increasing the fidelity of our `guides` and `examples`. If you have an example you'd like see, please open a GitHub discussion!

Our `@keystone-6/*` packages are written for the Node Maintenance and Active LTS versions of Node; and our continuous integration seamlessly tracks that. You may have success with Node versions that are Pending or End-of-Life, but you may have problems too.
