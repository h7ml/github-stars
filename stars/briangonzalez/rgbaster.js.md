description: ðŸŽ¨ A simple library for extracting dominant colors from images.
url: https://github.com/briangonzalez/rgbaster.js
---

A dead simple, zero-dependency, promise-based javascript library for extracting the dominant color(s) from an image (in the browser).

> ðŸ‘‰ Version 2 was written from the ground up with a clean and modern API, a robust test suite, and is fully written in Typescript.

Installation
------------

```
npm install --save rgbaster
```

Usage
-----

This library exports a default function which returns a promise resolving to a sorted array with the most dominant color at index 0, secondary at index 1, so on and so forth.

\[
  { color: 'rgb(0,0,255)', count: 86  },
  { color: 'rgb(9,18,42)', count: 32  },
  { color: 'rgb(120,8,202)', count: 3  },
\]

import analyze from 'rgbaster'

const result \= await analyze('/2px-blue-and-1px-red-image.png') // also supports base64 encoded image strings

console.log(\`The dominant color is ${result\[0\].color} with ${result\[0\].count} occurrence(s)\`)
// => The  dominant color is rgb(0,0,255) with 2 occurrence(s)

console.log(\`The secondary color is ${result\[1\].color} with ${result\[1\].count} occurrence(s)\`)
// => The  secondary color is rgb(255,0,0) with 1 occurrence(s)

Configuration options
---------------------

You may pass an optional second parameter, an object, with the following options:

#### `ignore`

An array of colors to ignore (in the form of `rgb`) when counting colors.

const result \= await analyze('/image.png', { ignore: \[ 'rgb(255,255,255)', 'rgb(0,0,0)' \] })

#### `scale`

In order to achieve greater speed, you can have `rgbaster` scale down the image we use internally prior to analysis, thus decreasing accuracy.

const result \= await analyze('/image.png', { scale: 0.6 })

Browser support
---------------

`rgbaster` depends on the following browser functionality:

-   Canvas
-   CORS
