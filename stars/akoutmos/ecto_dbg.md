Installation
------------

Available in Hex, the package can be installed by adding `ecto_dbg` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

def deps do
  \[
    {:ecto\_dbg, "~> 0.5.0"}
  \]
end

Documentation can be found at https://hexdocs.pm/ecto\_dbg.

Example Output
--------------

After setting up EctoDbg in your application you can expect the following output from your Ecto queries when using the EctoDbg helpers:

Supporting EctoDbg
------------------

If you rely on this library help you debug your Ecto queries, it would much appreciated if you can give back to the project in order to help ensure its continued development.

Setting Up EctoDbg
------------------

After adding `{:ecto_dbg, "~> 0.1.0"}` in your `mix.exs` file and running `mix deps.get`, open your `repo.ex` file and add the following contents:

defmodule MyApp.Repo do
  use Ecto.Repo,
    otp\_app: :my\_app,
    adapter: Ecto.Adapters.Postgres

  use EctoDbg
end

You can also pass configuration options to `EctoDbg` if you so chose like so (see the `EctoDbg` module docs for more information):

defmodule MyApp.Repo do
  use Ecto.Repo,
    otp\_app: :my\_app,
    adapter: Ecto.Adapters.Postgres

  use EctoDbg, level: :info
end

With that in place, any time that you want to inspect a query that is executed by Ecto, all you need to do is the following

query \= from user in User

Repo.all\_and\_log(query)

By default the `use EctoDbg` macro will inject the debug functions into your repo module for only the `:test` and `:dev` `Mix.env()` environments. If you would like to override this default behaviour, you can do that by providing the `:only` option (this value should be a subset of the environments that you passed in your `mix.exs` file):

defmodule MyApp.Repo do
  use Ecto.Repo,
    otp\_app: :my\_app,
    adapter: Ecto.Adapters.Postgres

  use EctoDbg, only: :dev
end

If your queries are especially large, make sure you update your Logger configuration to support large log messages. Specifically the `:truncate` option.

Attribution
-----------

-   EctoDbg builds upon the EctoDevLogger package and has reused some of the code in that project to achieve a slightly different goal.
-   The logo for the project is an edited version of an SVG image from the unDraw project.
-   The EctoDbg library leans on the Rust library sqlformat-rs for SQL statement formatting. This is done through a Ruslter NIF I maintain called sql\_fmt.
