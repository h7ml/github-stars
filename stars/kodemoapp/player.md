Kodemo Player
-------------

This repo contains the @kodemo/player package which is responsible for rendering and navigating Kodemo documents. The player is a React component and it needs to be provided with a valid Kodemo document.

### Installation

To install and integrate @kodemo/player please follow the docs at https://kodemo.com/docs/player.

TLDR?

1.  Install @kodemo/player using your package manager of choice:

npm i @kodemo/player # yarn add @kodemo/player

1.  Import and render the `KodemoPlayer` component:

import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import { KodemoPlayer } from '@kodemo/player';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode\>
    <KodemoPlayer json\={{
      story: '<h1>Example Document</h1>',
      subjects: {
        f992151a: {
          type: 'code',
          name: 'file.js',
          language: "javascript",
          versions: {
            e60944c4: { value: 'const a = 123;', },
          }
        }
      }
    }}\></KodemoPlayer\>
  </React.StrictMode\>
)

### Adding New Subject Types

Each subject in Kodemo is its own React component. You can easily add your own subject types by following these steps:

1.  Create your subject component in the subjects directory. I recommend using AbstractSubject as a starting point.
2.  Export your subject from subjects/index.ts.
3.  Add your subject to enum/SubjectType.ts.

### Terminology

If you're planning to work with the Kodemo source here are a few key concepts and names that are good to know about.

-   The `story` is the main body text of the documentation.
-   `Subjects` are the individual pieces of content that the documentation covers. A subject can be an image, code, etc.
-   Subjects can have multiple `versions`. Each version represents a variant of the same subject. For example, multiple versions are used to animate lines being added or removed from code.
-   The `timeline` is the bar with vertical line segments that indicate which subject that will become active when scrolling.
-   `Effects` are keywords within the story that are linked to a specific subject version. They form the relationship between the story and subjects.
