Discover Powerful Workflows
===========================

GitLens offers a wide range of features—here are the three most popular workflows that users rely on to boost their productivity:

-   **Interactive Code History** — Understanding code in repositories with multiple branches and contributors can be difficult. GitLens provides the context you need with tools like blame, hovers, and file annotations. But it doesn’t stop there—the interactive Commit Graph lets you create branches, rebase, revert, and more, all with powerful search capabilities.
    
-   **Accelerate PR Reviews** — Reduce context switching and manage all your PRs in one place. Prioritize tasks and identify bottlenecks right in VS Code with Launchpad when you integrate Github or other host providers. Work on multiple branches at once without disrupting your main workspace with Worktrees.
    
-   **Streamline Collaboration** — GitLens isn’t just for solo developers—it’s designed to enhance team collaboration. With Cloud Patches and Code Suggest, you can share and discuss suggested changes with any GitLens or GitKraken user, on multiple files and even PRs.
    

Home View - Your VS Code Workflow Hub
-------------------------------------

Compact but powerful, the Home View lets you take your tasks and issues from code to merge. Start work on an issue and create PRs in one intelligent view. The perfect companion for developers looking to reduce tedious context switching and stay focused on their work in VS Code.

Accelerate Your Workflow with AI (Preview)
------------------------------------------

GitLens leverages AI to simplify tedious tasks like writing commit messages, crafting pull request descriptions, generating changelogs and more—allowing you to focus on your code.

-   **Generate Commit and Stash Messages**: Quickly create descriptive commit or stash messages tailored to your code changes.
    
-   **Explain Commits**: Instantly understand the context of a commit through concise AI-generated explanations in the Inspect view.
    
-   **Open Pull Requests**: Automatically generate clear PR titles and descriptions directly from your branch changes, speeding up review cycles.
    
-   **Generate Changelogs**: Effortlessly summarize repository changes for release notes or documentation updates.
    
-   More coming soon!
    

**Community Features**: Community users can generate commit messages for free if they are using GitHub Copilot or have a free GitKraken account with an API key connected to other providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Gemini, etc.

**Pro Features**: Subscribe to GitLens Pro to access all AI features with GitKraken AI (Preview)—no manual key management required.

Interactive Code History
========================

Understanding who made changes, when, and why can be challenging. GitLens simplifies this with tools like the Commit Graph, Inspect, Inline Blame, and Hovers, giving you clear context and insights. Quickly explore your repository's history with intuitive visuals and actionable tools.

Blame, CodeLens, and Hovers
---------------------------

Gain a deeper understanding of how code changed and by whom through in-editor code annotations and rich hovers.

### Inline and Status Bar Blame

Provides historical context about line changes through unobtrusive **blame annotation** at the end of the current line and on the status bar.

Inline blame annotations

Status bar blame annotations

💡 Use the `Toggle Line Blame` and `Toggle Git CodeLens` commands from the Command Palette to turn the annotations on and off.

### Git CodeLens

Adds contextual and actionable authorship information at the top of each file and at the beginning of each block of code.

-   **Recent Change** — author and date of the most recent commit for the file or code block
-   **Authors** — number of authors of the file or code block and the most prominent author (if there is more than one)

### Rich Hovers

Hover over blame annotations to reveal rich details and actions.

File Annotations
----------------

Use on-demand whole file annotations to see authorship, recent changes, and a heatmap. Annotations are rendered as visual indicators directly in the editor.

File Blame annotations

File Changes annotations

File Heatmap annotations

💡 On an active file, use the `Toggle File Blame`, `Toggle File Changes`, and `Toggle File Heatmap` commands from the Command Palette to turn the annotations on and off.

Commit Graph `Pro`
------------------

Easily visualize your repository and keep track of all work in progress.

Use the rich commit search to find exactly what you're looking for. Its powerful filters allow you to search by a specific commit, message, author, a changed file or files, or even a specific code change. Learn more

💡Quickly toggle the Graph via the `Toggle Commit Graph` command.

💡Maximize the Graph via the `Toggle Maximized Commit Graph` command.

Revision Navigation
-------------------

With just a click of a button, you can navigate backwards and forwards through the history of any file. Compare changes over time and see the revision history of the whole file or an individual line.

Accelerate PR Reviews
=====================

PR reviews often require switching between GitHub, email, and your IDE. Launchpad is your centralized PR hub in VS Code where you can spot bottlenecks, prioritize reviews and unblock your team. With Worktrees, you can work on multiple branches—hotfixes, features, or experiments—without disrupting your workspace.

Launchpad `Pro`
---------------

Launchpad consolidates all your GitHub pull requests into a unified, actionable list. Focus on the most important reviews and take action to keep your team moving forward.. Learn more

Worktrees `Pro`
---------------

Worktrees enable efficient multitasking by allowing you to work on multiple branches without stashing changes or leaving your current branch. They preserve your workflow while letting you shift focus when needed. For example, you can easily review a pull request on a worktree in a separate VS Code window with GitLens.

Streamline Collaboration
========================

GitLens isn’t just for solo developers—it’s designed to enhance team collaboration. Sharing code can be tricky without adding noise to your repository with extra commits or branches. GitLens simplifies this with Cloud Patches and Code Suggest, letting you share or propose changes to any file in the repository without committing or pushing to a remote.

Cloud Patches `Preview`
-----------------------

Privately and securely share code changes by creating a Cloud Patch from your work-in-progress, commit, or stash, and sharing a link with specific teammates and other developers. Cloud Patches enable early collaboration for feedback on direction and approach, reducing rework and streamlining your workflow, without adding noise to your repositories. Learn more

Code Suggest `Preview`
----------------------

Break free from GitHub's limited, comment-only review feedback. With GitLens, you can suggest code changes directly from your IDE, just like editing a Google Doc. Provide feedback on any part of your project during a review—not just the lines changed in a PR. Learn more

More Features
=============

Side Bar Views
--------------

Our views are arranged for focus and productivity, although you can easily drag them around to suit your needs.

GitLens Inspect as shown above has been manually moved into the Secondary Side Bar

💡 Use the `Reset Views Layout` command to quickly get back to the default layout.
