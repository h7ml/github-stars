Important

#### Windows for ARM compatibility

Open-Shell is compatible with Windows for ARM since version 4.4.196.

If you install older one on a Windows for ARM installation (ex. using Parallels Desktop on an Apple Silicon Mac), you will no longer be able to log into your account the next time you reboot. Please refrain from installing Open-Shell on Windows for ARM.

### Temporary Translation/Language Solution

1.  Download language DLL
2.  Place it either in the Open-Shell's **install folder** or in the `%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\OpenShell\Languages` folder
