iOS WebKit Debug Proxy
======================

The ios\_webkit\_debug\_proxy (aka _iwdp_) proxies requests from usbmuxd daemon over a websocket connection, allowing developers to send commands to MobileSafari and UIWebViews on real and simulated iOS devices.

Installation
------------

iOS WebKit Debug Proxy works on Linux, MacOS & Windows.

### MacOS

It's easiest to install with homebrew:

brew install ios-webkit-debug-proxy

### Windows

It's easiest to install with scoop:

```
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install ios-webkit-debug-proxy
```

Note: you also need the latest version of iTunes installed.

### Linux

Install dependencies available in apt repository:

sudo apt-get install autoconf automake libusb-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libplist-dev libtool libssl-dev

Build and install dependencies that require more recent versions:

-   libplist
-   libimobiledevice-glue
-   libusbmuxd
-   libimobiledevice
-   usbmuxd

#### Fedora specific

Install dependencies:

sudo dnf install autoconf automake libusb1-devel libusb-compat-0.1-devel libtool openssl-devel

If you do not want to build and install the most recent versions of the noted libs:

sudo dnf install libplist-devel usbmuxd libimobiledevice-devel libimobiledevice-utils libimobiledevice-glue-devel

Build and install `ios-webkit-debug-proxy`:

git clone https://github.com/google/ios-webkit-debug-proxy.git
cd ios-webkit-debug-proxy

./autogen.sh
make
sudo make install

Usage
-----

On Linux, you must run the `usbmuxd` daemon. The above install adds a /lib/udev rule to start the daemon whenever a device is attached.

To verify that usbmuxd can list your attached device(s), ensure that `libimobiledevice-utils` is installed and then run `idevice_id -l`.

### Start the simulator or device

The iOS Simulator is supported, but it must be started **before** the proxy. The simulator can be started in XCode, standalone, or via the command line:

# Xcode changes these paths frequently, so doublecheck them
SDK\_DIR="/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs"
SIM\_APP="/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Applications/Simulator.app/Contents/MacOS/Simulator"
$SIM\_APP -SimulateApplication $SDK\_DIR/iPhoneSimulator8.4.sdk/Applications/MobileSafari.app/MobileSafari

#### Enable the inspector

Your attached iOS devices must have â‰¥1 open browser tabs and the inspector enabled via: `Settings > Safari > Advanced > Web Inspector = ON`

### Start the proxy

ios\_webkit\_debug\_proxy

-   `--debug` for verbose output.
-   `--frontend` to specify a frontend
-   `--help` for more options.
-   `Ctrl-C` to quit. Also, the proxy can be left running as a background process.

### Using with DevTools

ios\_webkit\_debug\_proxy can be used with many tools such as Chrome DevTools and Safari Web Inspector.

#### Chrome Devtools

In recent versions of Chrome and Safari there're major discrepancies between Chrome Remote Debugging Protocol and Webkit Inspector Protocol, which means that newer versions of Chrome DevTools aren't compatible with Safari.

#### Safari Web Inspector

You can use Safari Web Inspector extracted from Webkit sources, e.g. artygus/webkit-webinspector or HimbeersaftLP/ios-safari-remote-debug-kit.

#### Firefox DevTools via Valence

Another option is mozilla/valence which enables Firefox DevTools to be used with iOS.

Configuration
-------------

### View and inspect debuggable tabs

Navigate to localhost:9221. You'll see a listing of all connected devices.

Click through to view tabs available on each, and click through again to open the DevTools for a tab.

### Setting the DevTools UI URL

Chrome DevTools UI used as a default frontend:

```
http://chrome-devtools-frontend.appspot.com/static/27.0.1453.93/devtools.html
```

You can use the `-f` argument to specify different frontend source, like Chrome's local DevTools, a local Chromium checkout or another URL:

\# examples:
ios\_webkit\_debug\_proxy -f chrome-devtools://devtools/bundled/inspector.html
ios\_webkit\_debug\_proxy -f ~/chromium/src/third\_party/WebKit/Source/devtools/front\_end/inspector.html
ios\_webkit\_debug\_proxy -f http://foo.com:1234/bar/inspector.html

If you use `-f chrome-devtools://devtools/bundled/inspector.html`, you won't be able to click the links shown in `localhost:9222` as Chrome blocks clicking these URLs. However, you can copy/paste them into the address bar.

Just the same, you can apply the appropriate port (9222) and page (2) values below.

```
chrome-devtools://devtools/bundled/inspector.html?ws=localhost:9222/devtools/page/1
```

The `-f` value must end in ".html". Due to security reasons, `https` URLs will not work; use `http` or force-allow with the URL bar's shield icon. As of Chrome 45, the primary URL changed from `devtools.html` to `inspector.html`.

To disable the frontend proxy, use the `--no-frontend` argument.

#### Port assigment

The default configuration works well for most developers. The device\_id-to-port assignment defaults to:

```
:9221 for the device list
:9222 for the first iOS device that is attached
:9223 for the second iOS device that is attached
...
:9322 for the max device
```

If a port is in use then the next available port will be used, up to the range limit.

The port assignment is first-come-first-serve but is preserved if a device is detached and reattached, assuming that the proxy is not restarted, e.g.:

1.  start the proxy
2.  the device list gets :9221
3.  attach A gets :9222
4.  attach B gets :9223
5.  detach A, doesn't affect B's port
6.  attach C gets :9224 (not :9222)
7.  reattach A gets :9222 again (not :9225)

The port assignment rules can be set via the command line with `-c`. The default is equivalent to:

```
ios_webkit_debug_proxy -c null:9221,:9222-9322
```

where "null" represents the device list. The following example restricts the proxy to a single device and port:

```
ios_webkit_debug_proxy -c 4ea8dd11e8c4fbc1a2deadbeefa0fd3bbbb268c7:9227
```

### Troubleshooting

##### undefined reference to symbol 'log10@@GLIBC\_2.2.5'

/usr/bin/ld: ios\_webkit\_debug\_proxy-char\_buffer.o: undefined reference to symbol 'log10@@GLIBC\_2.2.5'
//lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6: error adding symbols: DSO missing from command line

Run this before `make`: `./configure LIBS="-lm"`

##### error while loading shared libraries: libimobiledevice.so.6

ios\_webkit\_debug\_proxy: error while loading shared libraries: libimobiledevice.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Run `sudo ldconfig`

##### idevice\_id not found

The `idevice_id` executable may be found as part of the libimobiledevice-utils package.

##### could not start com.apple.webinspector! success

Remove and rebuild libimobiledevice.

##### Could not connect to lockdownd (or doesn't work with iOS10+)

> Could not connect to lockdownd. Exiting.: No such file or directory. Unable to attach inspector ios\_webkit\_debug\_proxy

Check the device for a prompt to trust the connected computer. Choose "Trust" and try again.

> Could not connect to lockdownd. Exiting.: Broken pipe. Unable to attach inspector

or

> Could not connect to lockdownd, error code -<number>. Exiting.

Make sure you're using latest version of ios-webkit-debug-proxy

##### Inspectable pages list is empty for iOS >= 12.2

Make sure you're using latest version of ios-webkit-debug-proxy

##### Can not see Simulator

-   Make sure you started simulator before the proxy
-   Check that webinspector switch is enabled (Settings -> Safari -> Advanced -> Web Inspector)
-   Most likely simulator's web inspector daemon listens on ipv6 interface, check that you have `::1 localhost` line in `/etc/hosts`

##### Building under Rosetta (OS X)

libimobildevice formulae depends on openssl@1.1, which is key-only and requires the following env paths for the build

export PKG\_CONFIG\_PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib/pkgconfig"
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/include"

##### If no luck so far...

Lastly, always try replugging in the USB cable.

IWDP Clients
------------

JSON-formatted APIs are provided for programmatic clients.

-   http://localhost:9222/json to list device ":9222"'s tabs
-   ws://localhost:9222/devtools/page/1 to inspect a tab.

See the examples/README for example clients: NodeJS, C, clientside JS, websocket and more.
