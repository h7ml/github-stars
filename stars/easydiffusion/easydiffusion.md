Easy Diffusion 3.0
==================

### An easy way to install and use Stable Diffusion on your computer.

Does not require technical knowledge, does not require pre-installed software. 1-click install, powerful features, friendly community.

Ô∏è‚Äçüî•üéâ **New!** Support for Flux has been added in the beta branch (v3.5 engine)!

Installation
============

Click the download button for your operating system:

**Hardware requirements:**

-   **Windows:** NVIDIA¬π or AMD graphics card (minimum 2 GB RAM), or run on your CPU.
-   **Linux:** NVIDIA¬π or AMD¬≤ graphics card (minimum 2 GB RAM), or run on your CPU.
-   **Mac:** M1/M2/M3/M4 or AMD graphics card (Intel Mac), or run on your CPU.
-   Minimum 8 GB of system RAM.
-   Atleast 25 GB of space on the hard disk.

¬π) CUDA Compute capability level of 3.7 or higher required.

¬≤) ROCm 5.2 (or newer) support required.

The installer will take care of whatever is needed. If you face any problems, you can join the friendly Discord community and ask for assistance.

On Windows:
-----------

1.  Run the downloaded `Easy-Diffusion-Windows.exe` file.
2.  Run `Easy Diffusion` once the installation finishes. You can also start from your Start Menu, or from your desktop (if you created a shortcut).

If Windows SmartScreen prevents you from running the program click `More info` and then `Run anyway`.

**Tip:** On Windows 10, please install at the top level in your drive, e.g. `C:\EasyDiffusion` or `D:\EasyDiffusion`. This will avoid a common problem with Windows 10 (file path length limits).

On Linux/Mac:
-------------

1.  Unzip/extract the folder `easy-diffusion` which should be in your downloads folder, unless you changed your default downloads destination.
2.  Open a terminal window, and navigate to the `easy-diffusion` directory.
3.  Run `./start.sh` (or `bash start.sh`) in a terminal.

To remove/uninstall:
====================

Just delete the `EasyDiffusion` folder to uninstall all the downloaded packages.

Easy for new users, powerful features for advanced users
========================================================

Features:
---------

### User experience

-   **Hassle-free installation**: Does not require technical knowledge, does not require pre-installed software. Just download and run!
-   **Clutter-free UI**: A friendly and simple UI, while providing a lot of powerful features.
-   **Task Queue**: Queue up all your ideas, without waiting for the current task to finish.
-   **Intelligent Model Detection**: Automatically figures out the YAML config file to use for the chosen model (via a models database).
-   **Live Preview**: See the image as the AI is drawing it.
-   **Image Modifiers**: A library of _modifier tags_ like _"Realistic"_, _"Pencil Sketch"_, _"ArtStation"_ etc. Experiment with various styles quickly.
-   **Multiple Prompts File**: Queue multiple prompts by entering one prompt per line, or by running a text file.
-   **Save generated images to disk**: Save your images to your PC!
-   **UI Themes**: Customize the program to your liking.
-   **Searchable models dropdown**: organize your models into sub-folders, and search through them in the UI.

### Powerful image generation

-   **Supports**: "_Text to Image_", "_Image to Image_" and "_InPainting_"
-   **ControlNet**: For advanced control over the image, e.g. by setting the pose or drawing the outline for the AI to fill in.
-   **16 Samplers**: `PLMS`, `DDIM`, `DEIS`, `Heun`, `Euler`, `Euler Ancestral`, `DPM2`, `DPM2 Ancestral`, `LMS`, `DPM Solver`, `DPM++ 2s Ancestral`, `DPM++ 2m`, `DPM++ 2m SDE`, `DPM++ SDE`, `DDPM`, `UniPC`.
-   **Stable Diffusion XL and 2.1**: Generate higher-quality images using the latest Stable Diffusion XL models.
-   **Textual Inversion Embeddings**: For guiding the AI strongly towards a particular concept.
-   **Simple Drawing Tool**: Draw basic images to guide the AI, without needing an external drawing program.
-   **Face Correction (GFPGAN)**
-   **Upscaling (RealESRGAN)**
-   **Loopback**: Use the output image as the input image for the next image task.
-   **Negative Prompt**: Specify aspects of the image to _remove_.
-   **Attention/Emphasis**: `+` in the prompt increases the model's attention to enclosed words, and `-` decreases it. E.g. `apple++ falling from a tree`.
-   **Weighted Prompts**: Use weights for specific words in your prompt to change their importance, e.g. `(red)2.4 (dragon)1.2`.
-   **Prompt Matrix**: Quickly create multiple variations of your prompt, e.g. `a photograph of an astronaut riding a horse | illustration | cinematic lighting`.
-   **Prompt Set**: Quickly create multiple variations of your prompt, e.g. `a photograph of an astronaut on the {moon,earth}`
-   **1-click Upscale/Face Correction**: Upscale or correct an image after it has been generated.
-   **Make Similar Images**: Click to generate multiple variations of a generated image.
-   **NSFW Setting**: A setting in the UI to control _NSFW content_.
-   **JPEG/PNG/WEBP output**: Multiple file formats.

### Advanced features

-   **Custom Models**: Use your own `.ckpt` or `.safetensors` file, by placing it inside the `models/stable-diffusion` folder!
-   **Stable Diffusion XL and 2.1 support**
-   **Merge Models**
-   **Use custom VAE models**
-   **Textual Inversion Embeddings**
-   **ControlNet**
-   **Use custom GFPGAN models**
-   **UI Plugins**: Choose from a growing list of community-generated UI plugins, or write your own plugin to add features to the project!

### Performance and security

-   **Fast**: Creates a 512x512 image with euler\_a in 5 seconds, on an NVIDIA 3060 12GB.
-   **Low Memory Usage**: Create 512x512 images with less than 2 GB of GPU RAM, and 768x768 images with less than 3 GB of GPU RAM!
-   **Use CPU setting**: If you don't have a compatible graphics card, but still want to run it on your CPU.
-   **Multi-GPU support**: Automatically spreads your tasks across multiple GPUs (if available), for faster performance!
-   **Auto scan for malicious models**: Uses picklescan to prevent malicious models.
-   **Safetensors support**: Support loading models in the safetensor format, for improved safety.
-   **Auto-updater**: Gets you the latest improvements and bug-fixes to a rapidly evolving project.
-   **Developer Console**: A developer-mode for those who want to modify their Stable Diffusion code, modify packages, and edit the conda environment.
