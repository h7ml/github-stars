To continue improving your experience, we have to eventually deprecate or remove certain addons in favor of new and better tools.

If you're using info/notes, we highly recommend you migrate to docs instead, and here is a guide to help you.

If you're using contexts, we highly recommend you migrate to toolbars and here is a guide to help you.

If you're using addon-storyshots, we highly recommend you migrate to the Storybook test-runner and here is a guide to help you.

### Development scripts

Storybook is organized as a monorepo. Useful scripts include:

#### `yarn start`

> Runs a sandbox template storybook with test stories

#### `yarn task`

> As above, but gives you options to customize the sandbox (e.g. selecting other frameworks)

#### `yarn lint`

> boolean check if code conforms to linting rules - uses remark & eslint

-   `yarn lint:js` - will check js
-   `yarn lint:md` - will check markdown + code samples
-   `yarn lint:js --fix` - will automatically fix js

#### `yarn test`

> boolean check if unit tests all pass - uses jest

-   `yarn run test --core --watch` - will run core tests in watch-mode
