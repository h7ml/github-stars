Get Started
-----------

Install it (the package is called "git-delta" in most package managers, but the executable is just `delta`) and add this to your `~/.gitconfig`:

\[core\]
    pager \= delta

\[interactive\]
    diffFilter \= delta \--color-only

\[delta\]
    navigate \= true  # use n and N to move between diff sections
    dark \= true      # or light = true, or omit for auto-detection

\[merge\]
    conflictstyle \= zdiff3

Or run:

git config --global core.pager delta
git config --global interactive.diffFilter 'delta --color-only'
git config --global delta.navigate true
git config --global merge.conflictStyle zdiff3

Delta has many features and is very customizable; please see `delta -h` (short help) or `delta --help` (full manual), or the online user manual.

Features
--------

-   Language syntax highlighting with the same syntax-highlighting themes as bat
-   Word-level diff highlighting using a Levenshtein edit inference algorithm
-   Side-by-side view with line-wrapping
-   Line numbering
-   `n` and `N` keybindings to move between files in large diffs, and between diffs in `log -p` views (`--navigate`)
-   Improved merge conflict display
-   Improved `git blame` display (syntax highlighting; `--hyperlinks` formats commits as links to hosting provider etc. Supported hosting providers are: GitHub, GitLab, SourceHut, Codeberg)
-   Syntax-highlights grep output from `rg`, `git grep`, `grep`, etc
-   Support for Git's `--color-moved` feature.
-   Code can be copied directly from the diff (`-/+` markers are removed by default).
-   `diff-highlight` and `diff-so-fancy` emulation modes
-   Commit hashes can be formatted as terminal hyperlinks to the hosting provider page (`--hyperlinks`). File paths can also be formatted as hyperlinks for opening in your OS.
-   Stylable box/line decorations to draw attention to commit, file and hunk header sections.
-   Style strings (foreground color, background color, font attributes) are supported for >20 stylable elements, using the same color/style language as git
-   Handles traditional unified diff output in addition to git output
-   Automatic detection of light/dark terminal background

A syntax-highlighting pager for git, diff, and grep output
----------------------------------------------------------

Code evolves, and we all spend time studying diffs. Delta aims to make this both efficient and enjoyable: it allows you to make extensive changes to the layout and styling of diffs, as well as allowing you to stay arbitrarily close to the default git/diff output.

### Syntax-highlighting themes

`delta --show-syntax-themes --dark`

`delta --show-syntax-themes --light`

  

### Side-by-side view

\[delta\]
    side-by-side \= true

By default, side-by-side view has line-numbers activated, and has syntax highlighting in both the left and right panels: \[config\]

Side-by-side view wraps long lines automatically:

### Line numbers
