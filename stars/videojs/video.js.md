Quick Start
-----------

Thanks to the awesome folks over at Fastly, there's a free, CDN hosted version of Video.js that anyone can use. Add these tags to your document's `<head>`:

<link href\="//vjs.zencdn.net/8.23.3/video-js.min.css" rel\="stylesheet"\>
<script src\="//vjs.zencdn.net/8.23.3/video.min.js"\></script\>

Alternatively, you can include Video.js by getting it from npm, downloading it from GitHub releases or by including it via unpkg or another JavaScript CDN, like CDNjs.

<!-- unpkg : use the latest version of Video.js -->
<link href\="https://unpkg.com/video.js/dist/video-js.min.css" rel\="stylesheet"\>
<script src\="https://unpkg.com/video.js/dist/video.min.js"\></script\>

<!-- unpkg : use a specific version of Video.js (change the version numbers as necessary) -->
<link href\="https://unpkg.com/video.js@8.23.3/dist/video-js.min.css" rel\="stylesheet"\>
<script src\="https://unpkg.com/video.js@8.23.3/dist/video.min.js"\></script\>

<!-- cdnjs : use a specific version of Video.js (change the version numbers as necessary) -->
<link href\="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/video.js/8.23.3/video-js.min.css" rel\="stylesheet"\>
<script src\="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/video.js/8.23.3/video.min.js"\></script\>

Next, using Video.js is as simple as creating a `<video>` element, but with an additional `data-setup` attribute. At a minimum, this attribute must have a value of `'{}'`, but it can include any Video.js options - just make sure it contains valid JSON!

<video
    id\="my-player"
    class\="video-js"
    controls
    preload\="auto"
    poster\="//vjs.zencdn.net/v/oceans.png"
    data-setup\='{}'\>
  <source src\="//vjs.zencdn.net/v/oceans.mp4" type\="video/mp4"\></source\>
  <source src\="//vjs.zencdn.net/v/oceans.webm" type\="video/webm"\></source\>
  <source src\="//vjs.zencdn.net/v/oceans.ogv" type\="video/ogg"\></source\>
  <p class\="vjs-no-js"\>
    To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a
    web browser that
    <a href\="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target\="\_blank"\>
      supports HTML5 video
    </a\>
  </p\>
</video\>

When the page loads, Video.js will find this element and automatically setup a player in its place.

If you don't want to use automatic setup, you can leave off the `data-setup` attribute and initialize a `<video>` element manually using the `videojs` function:

var player \= videojs('my-player');

The `videojs` function also accepts an `options` object and a callback to be invoked when the player is ready:

var options \= {};

var player \= videojs('my-player', options, function onPlayerReady() {
  videojs.log('Your player is ready!');

  // In this context, \`this\` is the player that was created by Video.js.
  this.play();

  // How about an event listener?
  this.on('ended', function() {
    videojs.log('Awww...over so soon?!');
  });
});
