üöÄ Introduction
---------------

Since its initial release, PaddleOCR has gained widespread acclaim across academia, industry, and research communities, thanks to its cutting-edge algorithms and proven performance in real-world applications. It's already powering popular open-source projects like Umi-OCR, OmniParser, MinerU, and RAGFlow, making it the go-to OCR toolkit for developers worldwide.

On May 20, 2025, the PaddlePaddle team unveiled PaddleOCR 3.0, fully compatible with the official release of the **PaddlePaddle 3.0** framework. This update further **boosts text-recognition accuracy**, adds support for **multiple text-type recognition** and **handwriting recognition**, and meets the growing demand from large-model applications for **high-precision parsing of complex documents**. When combined with the **ERNIE 4.5 Turbo**, it significantly enhances key-information extraction accuracy. PaddleOCR 3.0 also introduces support for Chinese Heterogeneous AI Accelerators such as **KUNLUNXIN** and **Ascend**. For the complete usage documentation, please refer to the PaddleOCR 3.0 Documentation.

Three Major New Features in PaddleOCR 3.0:

-   Universal-Scene Text Recognition Model PP-OCRv5: A single model that handles five different text types plus complex handwriting. Overall recognition accuracy has increased by 13 percentage points over the previous generation. Online Demo
    
-   General Document-Parsing Solution PP-StructureV3: Delivers high-precision parsing of multi-layout, multi-scene PDFs, outperforming many open- and closed-source solutions on public benchmarks. Online Demo
    
-   Intelligent Document-Understanding Solution PP-ChatOCRv4: Natively powered by the ERNIE 4.5 Turbo, achieving 15 percentage points higher accuracy than its predecessor. Online Demo
    

In addition to providing an outstanding model library, PaddleOCR 3.0 also offers user-friendly tools covering model training, inference, and service deployment, so developers can rapidly bring AI applications to production.

üì£ Recent updates
-----------------

#### **2025.06.26: Release of PaddleOCR 3.0.3**, includes:

-   Bug Fix: Resolved the issue where the `enable_mkldnn` parameter was not effective, restoring the default behavior of using MKL-DNN for CPU inference.

#### üî•üî• **2025.06.19: Release of PaddleOCR 3.0.2**, includes:

-   **New Features:**
    
    -   The default download source has been changed from `BOS` to `HuggingFace`. Users can also change the environment variable `PADDLE_PDX_MODEL_SOURCE` to `BOS` to set the model download source back to Baidu Object Storage (BOS).
    -   Added service invocation examples for six languages‚ÄîC++, Java, Go, C#, Node.js, and PHP‚Äîfor pipelines like PP-OCRv5, PP-StructureV3, and PP-ChatOCRv4.
    -   Improved the layout partition sorting algorithm in the PP-StructureV3 pipeline, enhancing the sorting logic for complex vertical layouts to deliver better results.
    -   Enhanced model selection logic: when a language is specified but a model version is not, the system will automatically select the latest model version supporting that language.
    -   Set a default upper limit for MKL-DNN cache size to prevent unlimited growth, while also allowing users to configure cache capacity.
    -   Updated default configurations for high-performance inference to support Paddle MKL-DNN acceleration and optimized the logic for automatic configuration selection for smarter choices.
    -   Adjusted the logic for obtaining the default device to consider the actual support for computing devices by the installed Paddle framework, making program behavior more intuitive.
    -   Added Android example for PP-OCRv5. Details.
-   **Bug Fixes:**
    
    -   Fixed an issue with some CLI parameters in PP-StructureV3 not taking effect.
    -   Resolved an issue where `export_paddlex_config_to_yaml` would not function correctly in certain cases.
    -   Corrected the discrepancy between the actual behavior of `save_path` and its documentation description.
    -   Fixed potential multithreading errors when using MKL-DNN in basic service deployment.
    -   Corrected channel order errors in image preprocessing for the Latex-OCR model.
    -   Fixed channel order errors in saving visualized images within the text recognition module.
    -   Resolved channel order errors in visualized table results within PP-StructureV3 pipeline.
    -   Fixed an overflow issue in the calculation of `overlap_ratio` under extremely special circumstances in the PP-StructureV3 pipeline.
-   **Documentation Improvements:**
    
    -   Updated the description of the `enable_mkldnn` parameter in the documentation to accurately reflect the program's actual behavior.
    -   Fixed errors in the documentation regarding the `lang` and `ocr_version` parameters.
    -   Added instructions for exporting production line configuration files via CLI.
    -   Fixed missing columns in the performance data table for PP-OCRv5.
    -   Refined benchmark metrics for PP-StructureV3 across different configurations.
-   **Others:**
    
    -   Relaxed version restrictions on dependencies like numpy and pandas, restoring support for Python 3.12.

**History Log**

#### **üî•üî• 2025.06.05: Release of PaddleOCR 3.0.1, includes:**

-   **Optimisation of certain models and model configurations:**
    
    -   Updated the default model configuration for PP-OCRv5, changing both detection and recognition from mobile to server models. To improve default performance in most scenarios, the parameter `limit_side_len` in the configuration has been changed from 736 to 64.
    -   Added a new text line orientation classification model `PP-LCNet_x1_0_textline_ori` with an accuracy of 99.42%. The default text line orientation classifier for OCR, PP-StructureV3, and PP-ChatOCRv4 pipelines has been updated to this model.
    -   Optimised the text line orientation classification model `PP-LCNet_x0_25_textline_ori`, improving accuracy by 3.3 percentage points to a current accuracy of 98.85%.
-   **Optimizations and fixes for some issues in version 3.0.0, details**
