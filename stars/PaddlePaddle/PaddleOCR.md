    **Single model supports five text types** (Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, English, Japanese, and Pinyin) with **13% accuracy improvement**. Solves multilingual mixed document recognition challenges.
    
-   **PP-StructureV3 — Complex Document Parsing**  
    Intelligently converts complex PDFs and document images into **Markdown and JSON files that preserve original structure**. **Outperforms** numerous commercial solutions in public benchmarks. **Perfectly maintains document layout and hierarchical structure**.
    
-   **PP-ChatOCRv4 — Intelligent Information Extraction**  
    Natively integrates ERNIE 4.5 to **precisely extract key information** from massive documents, with 15% accuracy improvement over previous generation. Makes documents "**understand**" your questions and provide accurate answers.
    

In addition to providing an outstanding model library, PaddleOCR 3.0 also offers user-friendly tools covering model training, inference, and service deployment, so developers can rapidly bring AI applications to production.

**Special Note**: PaddleOCR 3.x introduces several significant interface changes. **Old code written based on PaddleOCR 2.x is likely incompatible with PaddleOCR 3.x**. Please ensure that the documentation you are reading matches the version of PaddleOCR you are using. This document explains the reasons for the upgrade and the major changes from PaddleOCR 2.x to 3.x.
