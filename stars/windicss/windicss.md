Windi CSS
============

  
  

Next generation utility-first CSS framework.

Why Windi CSS? 🤔
-----------------

A quote from the author should illustrate his motivation to create Windi CSS:

> When my project became larger and there were about dozens of components, the initial compilation time reached 3s, and hot updates took more than 1s with Tailwind CSS. - @voorjaar

By scanning your HTML and CSS and generating utilities on demand, Windi CSS is able to provide faster load times and a speedy HMR in development, and does not require purging in production.
