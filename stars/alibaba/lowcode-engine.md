LowCodeEngine
=============

An enterprise-class low-code technology stack with scale-out design

English | ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá

‚ú® Features
----------

-   üåà An extension-oriented kernel engine extracted from an enterprise-level low-code platform, pursuing the design concept of the smallest kernel and the strongest ecology
-   üì¶ Out-of-the-box high-quality ecological elements, including material systems, setters, plugins, etc.
-   ‚öôÔ∏è A complete tool chain, supporting the full-link R&D cycle of ecological elements such as material systems, setters, and plug-ins
-   üîå Powerful expansion capability, has supported nearly 100 various vertical low-code platforms
-   üõ° Developed with TypeScript, providing complete type definition files

üéØ Compatible Environments
--------------------------

-   Modern browsers (Chrome >= 80, Edge >= 80, last 2 safari versions, last 2 firefox versions)

üìö Engine Protocol
------------------

The engine fully implements the "LowCodeEngine Basic Construction Protocol Specification" and "LowCodeEngine Material Protocol Specification". The protocol stack is a key part of whether materials in the low-code field can be circulated.

üå∞ Usage example
----------------

npm install @alilc/lowcode-engine --save-dev

> **TIPS: Only cdn import is supported, npm package is used to provide code hinting capabilities such as typings**

import { init, skeleton } from '@alilc/lowcode-engine';

skeleton.add({
  area: 'topArea',
  type: 'Widget',
  name: 'logo',
  content: YourFantasticLogo,
  contentProps: {
    logo:
      'https://img.alicdn.com/tfs/TB1\_SocGkT2gK0jSZFkXXcIQFXa-66-66.png',
    href: '/',
  },
  props: {
    align: 'left',
    width: 100,
  },
});

init(document.getElementById('lce'));

### Engineering configuration:

{
  "externals": {
    "@alilc/lowcode-engine": "var window.AliLowCodeEngine",
    "@alilc/lowcode-engine-ext": "var window.AliLowCodeEngineExt"
  }
}

### cdn optional method:

#### Method 1: alifd cdn

https://alifd.alicdn.com/npm/@alilc/lowcode-engine@1.0.18/dist/js/engine-core.js

https://alifd.alicdn.com/npm/@alilc/lowcode-react-simulator-renderer@1.0.18/dist/js/react-simulator-renderer.js

#### Method 2: uipaas cdn

https://uipaas-assets.com/prod/npm/@alilc/lowcode-engine/1.0.18/dist/js/engine-core.js

https://uipaas-assets.com/prod/npm/@alilc/lowcode-react-simulator-renderer/1.0.18/dist/js/react-simulator-renderer.js

#### Method 3: unpkg

https://unpkg.com/@alilc/lowcode-engine@1.0.18/dist/js/engine-core.js

https://unpkg.com/@alilc/lowcode-react-simulator-renderer@1.0.18/dist/js/react-simulator-renderer.js

#### Method 4: jsdelivr

https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@alilc/lowcode-engine@1.0.18/dist/js/engine-core.js

https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@alilc/lowcode-react-simulator-renderer@1.0.18/dist/js/react-simulator-renderer.js

#### Method 5: Use your own cdn

Pass the files under packages/engine/dist and packages/react-simulator-renderer/dist in the source code to your cdn provider

üíª Local debugging
------------------

$ git clone git@github.com:alibaba/lowcode-engine.git
$ cd lowcode-engine
$ npm install
$ npm run setup
$ npm start

> üì¢ npm access speed is slow, Alibaba employees can use tnpm, other students recommend using cnpm or specifying a mirror registry.
> 
> üì¢ Windows environment must use WSL, other terminals are not guaranteed to work normally

After lowcode-engine is started, several umd files are provided, which can be debugged in combination with the lowcode-demo project. Refer to the file proxy rules here.

ü§ù Participation

Please read first:

1.  How to configure the engine debugging environment?
2.  About the R&D collaboration process of the engine
3.  Engineering Configuration of Engine

> Strongly recommend reading "The Wisdom of Asking Questions", \["How to Ask Questions to the Open Source Community"\](https: //github.com/seajs/seajs/issues/545) and How to Report Bugs Effectively, "How to Submit Unanswerable Questions to Open Source Projects", better questions are easier to get help.
