Getting started
---------------

Example:

Slidable(
  // Specify a key if the Slidable is dismissible.
  key: const ValueKey(0),

  // The start action pane is the one at the left or the top side.
  startActionPane: ActionPane(
    // A motion is a widget used to control how the pane animates.
    motion: const ScrollMotion(),

    // A pane can dismiss the Slidable.
    dismissible: DismissiblePane(onDismissed: () {}),

    // All actions are defined in the children parameter.
    children: const \[
      // A SlidableAction can have an icon and/or a label.
      SlidableAction(
        onPressed: doNothing,
        backgroundColor: Color(0xFFFE4A49),
        foregroundColor: Colors.white,
        icon: Icons.delete,
        label: 'Delete',
      ),
      SlidableAction(
        onPressed: doNothing,
        backgroundColor: Color(0xFF21B7CA),
        foregroundColor: Colors.white,
        icon: Icons.share,
        label: 'Share',
      ),
    \],
  ),

  // The end action pane is the one at the right or the bottom side.
  endActionPane: const ActionPane(
    motion: ScrollMotion(),
    children: \[
      SlidableAction(
        // An action can be bigger than the others.
        flex: 2,
        onPressed: doNothing,
        backgroundColor: Color(0xFF7BC043),
        foregroundColor: Colors.white,
        icon: Icons.archive,
        label: 'Archive',
      ),
      SlidableAction(
        onPressed: doNothing,
        backgroundColor: Color(0xFF0392CF),
        foregroundColor: Colors.white,
        icon: Icons.save,
        label: 'Save',
      ),
    \],
  ),

  // The child of the Slidable is what the user sees when the
  // component is not dragged.
  child: const ListTile(title: Text('Slide me')),
),

Motions
-------

Any `ActionPane` has a motion parameter which allow you to define how the pane animates when the user drag the `Slidable`.

### Behind Motion

The actions appear as if they where behind the `Slidable`:

### Drawer Motion

Animate the actions as if they were drawers, when the `Slidable` is moving:

### Scroll Motion

The actions follow the `Slidable` while it's moving:

### Stretch Motion

Animate the actions as if they were streched while the `Slidable` is moving:

### Controller

You can use `SlidableController` to open or close the actions programmatically:

final controller \= SlidableController();

// ...

Slidable(
  controller: controller,
  // ...
);

// ...

// Open the actions
void \_handleOpen() {
  controller.openEndActionPane();
  // OR
  //controller.openStartActionPane();
}

void \_handleOpen() {
  controller.close();
}
