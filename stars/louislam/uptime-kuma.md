Motivation
----------

-   I was looking for a self-hosted monitoring tool like "Uptime Robot", but it is hard to find a suitable one. One of the closest ones is statping. Unfortunately, it is not stable and no longer maintained.
-   Wanted to build a fancy UI.
-   Learn Vue 3 and vite.js.
-   Show the power of Bootstrap 5.
-   Try to use WebSocket with SPA instead of a REST API.
-   Deploy my first Docker image to Docker Hub.

If you love this project, please consider giving it a ‚≠ê.
