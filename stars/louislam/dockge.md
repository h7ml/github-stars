üîß How to Install
-----------------

Requirements:

-   Docker 20+ / Podman
-   (Podman only) podman-docker (Debian: `apt install podman-docker`)
-   OS:
    -   Major Linux distros that can run Docker/Podman such as:
        -   ‚úÖ Ubuntu
        -   ‚úÖ Debian (Bullseye or newer)
        -   ‚úÖ Raspbian (Bullseye or newer)
        -   ‚úÖ CentOS
        -   ‚úÖ Fedora
        -   ‚úÖ ArchLinux
    -   ‚ùå Debian/Raspbian Buster or lower is not supported
    -   ‚ùå Windows (Will be supported later)
-   Arch: armv7, arm64, amd64 (a.k.a x86\_64)

### Basic

-   Default Stacks Directory: `/opt/stacks`
-   Default Port: 5001

```
# Create directories that store your stacks and stores Dockge's stack
mkdir -p /opt/stacks /opt/dockge
cd /opt/dockge

# Download the compose.yaml
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/louislam/dockge/master/compose.yaml --output compose.yaml

# Start the server
docker compose up -d

# If you are using docker-compose V1 or Podman
# docker-compose up -d
```

Dockge is now running on http://localhost:5001

### Advanced

If you want to store your stacks in another directory, you can generate your compose.yaml file by using the following URL with custom query strings.

```
# Download your compose.yaml
curl "https://dockge.kuma.pet/compose.yaml?port=5001&stacksPath=/opt/stacks" --output compose.yaml
```

-   port=`5001`
-   stacksPath=`/opt/stacks`

Interactive compose.yaml generator is available on: https://dockge.kuma.pet

How to Update
-------------

cd /opt/dockge
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d

Motivations
-----------

-   I have been using Portainer for some time, but for the stack management, I am sometimes not satisfied with it. For example, sometimes when I try to deploy a stack, the loading icon keeps spinning for a few minutes without progress. And sometimes error messages are not clear.
-   Try to develop with ES Module + TypeScript

If you love this project, please consider giving it a ‚≠ê.

FAQ
---

#### "Dockge"?

"Dockge" is a coinage word which is created by myself. I originally hoped it sounds like `Dodge`, but apparently many people called it `Dockage`, it is also acceptable.

The naming idea came from Twitch emotes like `sadge`, `bedge` or `wokege`. They all end in `-ge`.

#### Can I manage a single container without `compose.yaml`?

The main objective of Dockge is to try to use the docker `compose.yaml` for everything. If you want to manage a single container, you can just use Portainer or Docker CLI.

#### Can I manage existing stacks?

Yes, you can. However, you need to move your compose file into the stacks directory:

1.  Stop your stack
2.  Move your compose file into `/opt/stacks/<stackName>/compose.yaml`
3.  In Dockge, click the " Scan Stacks Folder" button in the top-right corner's dropdown menu
4.  Now you should see your stack in the list

#### Is Dockge a Portainer replacement?

Yes or no. Portainer provides a lot of Docker features. While Dockge is currently only focusing on docker-compose with a better user interface and better user experience.

If you want to manage your container with docker-compose only, the answer may be yes.

If you still need to manage something like docker networks, single containers, the answer may be no.

#### Can I install both Dockge and Portainer?

Yes, you can.

Others
------

Dockge is built on top of Compose V2. `compose.yaml` also known as `docker-compose.yml`.
