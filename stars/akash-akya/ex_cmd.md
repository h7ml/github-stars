ExCmd
=====

ExCmd is an Elixir library for running and communicating with external programs using a back-pressure mechanism. It provides a robust alternative to Elixir's built-in Port with improved memory management through demand-driven I/O.

The Port I/O Problem
--------------------

When using Elixir's built-in Port, running external programs that generate large amounts of output (like streaming video using `ffmpeg`) can quickly lead to memory issues. This happens because Port I/O is not demand-driven - it consumes output from stdout as soon as it's available and sends it to the process mailbox. Since BEAM process mailboxes are unbounded, the output accumulates there waiting to be received.

### Memory Usage Comparison

Let's look at how ExCmd handles memory compared to Port when processing large streams:

Using Port (memory grows unbounded):

Port.open({:spawn\_executable, "/bin/cat"}, \[{:args, \["/dev/random"\]}, {:line, 10}, :binary, :use\_stdio\])

Using ExCmd (memory remains stable):

ExCmd.stream!(~w(cat /dev/random))
|> Enum.each(fn data \->
  IO.puts(IO.iodata\_length(data))
end)

ExCmd solves this by implementing:

-   Demand-driven I/O with proper back-pressure
-   Efficient use of OS-backed stdio buffers
-   Stream-based API that integrates with Elixir's ecosystem

Key Features
------------

-   **Back-pressure Support**: Controls data flow between your application and external programs
-   **Stream Abstraction**: Seamless integration with Elixir's Stream API
-   **Memory Efficient**: Demand-driven I/O prevents memory issues with large data transfers
-   **Cross-platform**: Pre-built binaries for MacOS, Windows, and Linux
-   **Process Management**: Proper program termination with no zombie processes
-   **Selective I/O Control**: Ability to close stdin while keeping stdout open
-   **No Dependencies**: No separate middleware or shim installation required

Installation
------------

Add `ex_cmd` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

def deps do
  \[
    {:ex\_cmd, "~> x.x.x"}
  \]
end

Quick Start Examples
--------------------

### Basic Command Execution

\# Simple command execution
ExCmd.stream!(~w(echo Hello))
|> Enum.into("")
\# => "Hello\\n"

\# Get your IP address
ExCmd.stream!(~w(curl ifconfig.co))
|> Enum.into("")

### Working with Input Streams

\# String input
ExCmd.stream!(~w(cat), input: "Hello World")
|> Enum.into("")
\# => "Hello World"

\# List of strings
ExCmd.stream!(~w(cat), input: \["Hello", " ", "World"\])
|> Enum.into("")
\# => "Hello World"

\# Binary data
ExCmd.stream!(~w(base64), input: <<1, 2, 3, 4, 5\>>)
|> Enum.into("")
\# => "AQIDBAU=\\n"

\# IOData
ExCmd.stream!(~w(base64), input: \[<<1, 2\>>, \[3\], \[<<4, 5\>>\]\])
|> Enum.into("")
\# => "AQIDBAU=\\n"

### Media Processing Examples

\# Extract audio from video with controlled memory usage
ExCmd.stream!(~w(ffmpeg -i pipe:0 -f mp3 pipe:1),
  input: File.stream!("music\_video.mkv", \[\], 65536))
|> Stream.into(File.stream!("music.mp3"))
|> Stream.run()

\# Process video streams efficiently
ExCmd.stream!(~w(ffmpeg -i pipe:0 -c:v libx264 -f mp4 pipe:1),
  input: File.stream!("input.mp4", \[\], 65536),
  max\_chunk\_size: 65536)
|> Stream.into(File.stream!("output.mp4"))
|> Stream.run()

### Error Handling

\# stream!/2 raises on non-zero exit status
ExCmd.stream!(\["sh", "-c", "exit 10"\])
|> Enum.to\_list()
\# => \*\* (ExCmd.Stream.AbnormalExit) program exited with exit status: 10

\# stream/2 returns exit status as last element
ExCmd.stream(\["sh", "-c", "echo 'foo' && exit 10"\])
|> Enum.to\_list()
\# => \["foo\\n", {:exit, {:status, 10}}\]

### Advanced Features

\# Redirect stderr to stdout
ExCmd.stream!(\["sh", "-c", "echo foo; echo bar >&2"\],
  stderr: :redirect\_to\_stdout)
|> Enum.into("")
\# => "foo\\nbar\\n"

Alternatives
------------

-   For NIF-based solutions without middleware overhead, consider Exile
-   For simple command execution without streaming, Elixir's built-in Port might be sufficient
