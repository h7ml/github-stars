TensorFlow.js Examples
======================

This repository contains a set of examples implemented in TensorFlow.js.

Each example directory is standalone so the directory can be copied to another project.

Dependencies
============

Except for `getting_started`, all the examples require the following dependencies to be installed.

-   Node.js version 8.9 or higher
-   NPM cli OR Yarn

How to build an example
-----------------------

`cd` into the directory

If you are using `yarn`:

cd mnist-core
yarn
yarn watch

If you are using `npm`:

cd mnist-core
npm install
npm run watch

### Details

The convention is that each example contains two scripts:

-   `yarn watch` or `npm run watch`: starts a local development HTTP server which watches the filesystem for changes so you can edit the code (JS or HTML) and see changes when you refresh the page immediately.
    
-   `yarn build` or `npm run build`: generates a `dist/` folder which contains the build artifacts and can be used for deployment.
    

Contributing
------------

If you want to contribute an example, please reach out to us on Github issues before sending us a pull request as we are trying to keep this set of examples small and highly curated.

### Running Presubmit Tests

Before you send a pull request, it is a good idea to run the presubmit tests and make sure they all pass. To do that, execute the following commands in the root directory of tfjs-examples:

yarn
yarn presubmit

The `yarn presubmit` command executes the unit tests and lint checks of all the exapmles that contain the `yarn test` and/or `yarn lint` scripts. You may also run the tests for individual exampls by cd'ing into their respective subdirectory and executing `yarn`, followed by `yarn test` and/or `yarn lint`.
