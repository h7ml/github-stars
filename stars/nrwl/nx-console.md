Why Nx Console?
---------------

Developers use both command-line tools and user interfaces. They commit in the terminal, but resolve conflicts in Visual Studio Code or WebStorm. They use the right tool for the job.

Nx Console is that tool. It helps developers stay in the flow, provides visual workflows, enhances your AI chats and more.

Installation
------------

You can download Nx Console from the following places:

-   Nx Console for Visual Studio Code from the Visual Studio Marketplace.
-   Nx Console for Visual Studio Code from the OpenVSX Registry
-   Nx Console for JetBrains from the JetBrains Marketplace

Key Features
------------

### AI Enhancements

Nx Console enhances your editors AI features by providing relevant context to the large language models powering VSCode and Cursor. Automatically teach AI about your workspace architecture, generators and feed it up-to-date nx docs!

Nx Console comes with an MCP server for both, VSCode and Cursor.

You can also install the MCP server separately from the Nx Console extension via the `nx-mcp` NPM package. More about that here. Learn more in the Nx docs.

### Project Details View

Nx Console provides seamless integration with the Project Details View (PDV). You can learn more about your project, the available tasks and detailed configuration information. With the PDV in Nx Console, you can run tasks or navigate the task graph with just a few clicks!

Learn more about the Project Details view on nx.dev

### Generate UI

Nx Console makes it easier to run generators through our interactive Generate UI. It automatically parses the schema for any generator and provides autocomplete, validation and dry-run previews as you type.

You can launch the Generate UI via the `Nx: Generate (UI)` command or through the context menu in the file explorer. Paths will be automatically prefilled! Learn more about the Generate UI on nx.dev

### Nx Cloud Integration

Nx Console improves the experience of using Nx Cloud by giving you an overview of current CI Pipeline Executions and showing notifications when CI is done or an error occurs. No more refreshing GitHub forever, just keep working and Nx Console will let you know once your PR is ready!

Additionally, Nx Console helps by guiding you through the Nx Cloud onboarding process, right in your editor.

Learn more about the Nx Cloud Integration on nx.dev

### Projects & Tasks Overview

Nx Console presents an overview of your workspace from an Nx perspective. You can browse projects, their targets & configurations in the `Projects` view. Run available targets or create shortcuts for frequent commands in the `Common Nx Commands` view.

### Workspace Visualization

Nx Console visualizes the Nx project & task graphs right in your editor. It knows which file you're working on, so you can easily open the graph focused on that specific project. Also, with the tight integration into your editor, you can run tasks or explore the files that cause project dependencies with a single click.

Requirements
------------

To use Nx Console, make sure you're in an Nx or Lerna workspace and have Node.js installed. If you're not using Nx yet, learn more here: Intro to Nx

You can create an Nx workspace by running the following command:

npx create-nx-workspace@latest my-workspace
