React Joyride
=============

#### Create awesome tours for your app!

Showcase your app to new users or explain functionality of new features.

It uses react-floater for positioning and styling.  
And you can use your own components too!

**View the demo here** (or the codesandbox examples)

**Read the docs**

Talk about it on the Discussions board.

Setup
-----

npm i react-joyride

Getting Started
---------------

import Joyride from 'react-joyride';

export class App extends React.Component {
  state \= {
    steps: \[
      {
        target: '.my-first-step',
        content: 'This is my awesome feature!',
      },
      {
        target: '.my-other-step',
        content: 'This another awesome feature!',
      },
      ...
    \]
  };

  render () {
    const { steps } \= this.state;

    return (
      <div className\="app"\>
        <Joyride
          steps\={steps}
          ...
        /\>
        ...
      </div\>
    );
  }
}

> If you need to support legacy browsers you need to include the scrollingelement polyfill.
