WebTorrent  
  

======================

#### The streaming torrent client. For node.js and the web.

##### Sponsored by        

  

**WebTorrent** is a streaming torrent client for **node.js** and the **browser**. YEP, THAT'S RIGHT. THE BROWSER. It's written completely in JavaScript – the language of the web – so the same code works in both runtimes.

In node.js, this module is a simple torrent client, using TCP and UDP to talk to other torrent clients.

In the browser, WebTorrent uses **WebRTC** (data channels) for peer-to-peer transport. It can be used **without** browser plugins, extensions, or installations. It's Just JavaScript™. Note: WebTorrent does **not** support UDP/TCP peers in browser.

Simply include the `webtorrent.min.js` script on your page to start fetching files over WebRTC using the BitTorrent protocol, or `import WebTorrent from 'webtorrent'` with browserify or webpack. See demo apps and code examples below.

To make BitTorrent work over WebRTC (which is the only P2P transport that works on the web) we made some protocol changes. Therefore, a browser-based WebTorrent client or **"web peer"** can only connect to other clients that support WebTorrent/WebRTC.

To seed files to web peers, use a client that supports WebTorrent, e.g. WebTorrent Desktop, a desktop client with a familiar UI that can connect to web peers, webtorrent-hybrid, a command line program, or Instant.io, a website. Established torrent clients like **Vuze** have already added WebTorrent support so they can connect to both normal _and_ web peers. We hope other clients will follow.

### Features

-   **Torrent client for node.js & the browser** (same npm package!)
-   **Insanely fast**
-   Download **multiple torrents** simultaneously, efficiently
-   **Pure Javascript** (no native dependencies)
-   Exposes files as **streams**
    -   Fetches pieces from the network on-demand so seeking is supported (even before torrent is finished)
    -   Seamlessly switches between sequential and rarest-first piece selection strategy
-   Supports advanced torrent client features
    -   **magnet uri** support via **ut\_metadata**
    -   **peer discovery** via **dht**, **tracker**, **lsd**, and **ut\_pex**
    -   **protocol extension api** for adding new extensions
-   **Comprehensive test suite** (runs completely offline, so it's reliable and fast)
-   Check all the **supported BEPs here**

#### Browser/WebRTC environment features

-   **WebRTC data channels** for lightweight peer-to-peer communication with **no plugins**
-   **No silos.** WebTorrent is a P2P network for the **entire web.** WebTorrent clients running on one domain can connect to clients on any other domain.
-   Stream video torrents into a `<video>` tag (`webm, mkv, mp4, ogv, mov, etc (AV1, H264, HEVC*, VP8, VP9, AAC, FLAC, MP3, OPUS, Vorbis, etc)`)
-   Supports Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari.

### Install

To install WebTorrent for use in node or the browser with `import WebTorrent from 'webtorrent'`, run:

npm install webtorrent

To install a `webtorrent` command line program, run:

npm install webtorrent-cli -g

To install a WebTorrent desktop application for Mac, Windows, or Linux, see WebTorrent Desktop.

### Who is using WebTorrent today?

**Lots of folks!**

### WebTorrent API Documentation

**Read the full API Documentation.**

### Usage

WebTorrent is the first BitTorrent client that works in the browser, using open web standards (no plugins, just HTML5 and WebRTC)! It's easy to get started!

#### In the browser

##### Downloading a file is simple:

import WebTorrent from 'webtorrent'

const client \= new WebTorrent()
const magnetURI \= '...'

client.add(magnetURI, torrent \=> {
  // Got torrent metadata!
  console.log('Client is downloading:', torrent.infoHash)

  for (const file of torrent.files) {
    document.body.append(file.name)
  }
})

##### Seeding a file is simple, too:

import dragDrop from 'drag-drop'
import WebTorrent from 'webtorrent'

const client \= new WebTorrent()

// When user drops files on the browser, create a new torrent and start seeding it!
dragDrop('body', files \=> {
  client.seed(files, torrent \=> {
    console.log('Client is seeding:', torrent.infoHash)
  })
})

There are more examples in docs/get-started.md.

##### Browserify

WebTorrent works great with browserify, an npm package that lets you use node\-style require() to organize your browser code and load modules installed by npm (as seen in the previous examples).

##### Webpack

WebTorrent also works with webpack, another module bundler. However, webpack requires extra configuration which you can find in the webpack bundle config used by webtorrent.

Or, you can just use the pre-built version via `import WebTorrent from 'webtorrent/dist/webtorrent.min.js'` and skip the webpack configuration.

##### Script tag

WebTorrent is also available as a standalone script (`webtorrent.min.js`) which exposes `WebTorrent` on the `window` object, so it can be used with just a script tag:

<script type\='module'\>
  import WebTorrent from 'webtorrent.min.js'
</script\>

The WebTorrent script is also hosted on fast, reliable CDN infrastructure (Cloudflare and MaxCDN) for easy inclusion on your site:

<script type\='module'\>
  import WebTorrent from 'https://esm.sh/webtorrent'
</script\>

##### Chrome App

If you want to use WebTorrent in a Chrome App, you can include the following script:

<script type\='module'\>
  import WebTorrent from 'webtorrent.chromeapp.js'
</script\>

Be sure to enable the `chrome.sockets.udp` and `chrome.sockets.tcp` permissions!

#### In Node.js

WebTorrent also works in node.js, using the _same npm package!_ It's mad science!

**NOTE**: To connect to "web peers" (browsers) in addition to normal BitTorrent peers, use webtorrent-hybrid which includes WebRTC support for node.

#### As a command line app

WebTorrent is also available as a command line app. Here's how to use it:

$ npm install webtorrent-cli -g
$ webtorrent --help

To download a torrent:

$ webtorrent magnet\_uri

To stream a torrent to a device like **AirPlay** or **Chromecast**, just pass a flag:

$ webtorrent magnet\_uri --airplay

There are many supported streaming options:

\--airplay               Apple TV
--chromecast            Chromecast
--mplayer               MPlayer
--mpv                   MPV
--omx \[jack\]            omx \[default: hdmi\]
--vlc                   VLC
--xbmc                  XBMC
--stdout                standard out \[implies --quiet\]

In addition to magnet uris, WebTorrent supports many ways to specify a torrent.

### Modules

Most of the active development is happening inside of small npm packages which are used by WebTorrent.

#### The Node Way™

> "When applications are done well, they are just the really application-specific, brackish residue that can't be so easily abstracted away. All the nice, reusable components sublimate away onto github and npm where everybody can collaborate to advance the commons." — substack from "how I write modules"

#### Modules

These are the main modules that make up WebTorrent:

module

tests

version

description

**webtorrent**

**torrent client (this module)**

bittorrent-dht

distributed hash table client

bittorrent-peerid

identify client name/version

bittorrent-protocol

bittorrent protocol stream

bittorrent-tracker

bittorrent tracker server/client

bittorrent-lsd

bittorrent local service discovery

create-torrent

create .torrent files

magnet-uri

parse magnet uris

parse-torrent

parse torrent identifiers

torrent-discovery

find peers via dht, tracker, and lsd

ut\_metadata

metadata for magnet uris (protocol extension)

ut\_pex

peer discovery (protocol extension)

#### Enable debug logs

In **node**, enable debug logs by setting the `DEBUG` environment variable to the name of the module you want to debug (e.g. `bittorrent-protocol`, or `*` to print **all logs**).

DEBUG=\* webtorrent

In the **browser**, enable debug logs by running this in the developer console:

localStorage.setItem('debug', '\*')

Disable by running this:

localStorage.removeItem('debug')
