### Conquer of Completion

It is possible to use this package in your vim/neovim text editor, to make this possible, make sure you have the `coc.nvim` previously configured, then add this command to your `init.vim`

Plug 'dsznajder/vscode-es7-javascript-react-snippets', { 'do': 'yarn install --frozen-lockfile && yarn compile' }

Update your vim / neovim settings with `:source %` and then install the new package with `:PlugInstall`

Note: This example uses `vim-plug` as a package manager, feel free to use some other

  

### Packer

For use with packer the syntax is a little different. Just add in your `init.vim` or `init.lua`:

use {'dsznajder/vscode-es7-javascript-react-snippets',
run = 'yarn install --frozen-lockfile && yarn compile'
}

When saving the file, the update will be done ( `:w` )

--------------
