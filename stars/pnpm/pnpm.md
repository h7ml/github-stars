Fast, disk space efficient package manager:

-   **Fast.** Up to 2x faster than the alternatives (see benchmark).
-   **Efficient.** Files inside `node_modules` are linked from a single content-addressable storage.
-   **Great for monorepos.**
-   **Strict.** A package can access only dependencies that are specified in its `package.json`.
-   **Deterministic.** Has a lockfile called `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
-   **Works as a Node.js version manager.** See pnpm env use.
-   **Works everywhere.** Supports Windows, Linux, and macOS.
-   **Battle-tested.** Used in production by teams of all sizes since 2016.
-   See the full feature comparison with npm and Yarn.

To quote the Rush team:

> Microsoft uses pnpm in Rush repos with hundreds of projects and hundreds of PRs per day, and weâ€™ve found it to be very fast and reliable.

Background
----------

pnpm uses a content-addressable filesystem to store all files from all module directories on a disk. When using npm, if you have 100 projects using lodash, you will have 100 copies of lodash on disk. With pnpm, lodash will be stored in a content-addressable storage, so:

1.  If you depend on different versions of lodash, only the files that differ are added to the store. If lodash has 100 files, and a new version has a change only in one of those files, `pnpm update` will only add 1 new file to the storage.
2.  All the files are saved in a single place on the disk. When packages are installed, their files are linked from that single place consuming no additional disk space. Linking is performed using either hard-links or reflinks (copy-on-write).

As a result, you save gigabytes of space on your disk and you have a lot faster installations! If you'd like more details about the unique `node_modules` structure that pnpm creates and why it works fine with the Node.js ecosystem, read this small article: Flat node\_modules is not the only way.
