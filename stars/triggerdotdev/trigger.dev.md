About Trigger.dev
-----------------

Trigger.dev is an open source platform and SDK which allows you to create long-running background jobs. Write normal async code, deploy, and never hit a timeout.

### Key features:

-   JavaScript and TypeScript SDK
-   No timeouts
-   Retries (with exponential backoff)
-   Queues and concurrency controls
-   Schedules and crons
-   Full Observability; logs, live trace views, advanced filtering
-   React hooks to interact with the Trigger API from your React app
-   Pipe LLM streams straight to your users through the Realtime API
-   Trigger tasks and display the run status and metadata anywhere in your app
-   Custom alerts, get notified by email, Slack or webhooks
-   No infrastructure to manage
-   Elastic (scaling)
-   Works with your existing tech stack

In your codebase
----------------

Create tasks where they belong: in your codebase. Version control, localhost, test and review like you're already used to.

import { task } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";

//1. You need to export each task
export const helloWorld \= task({
  //2. Use a unique id for each task
  id: "hello-world",
  //3. The run function is the main function of the task
  run: async (payload: { message: string }) \=> {
    //4. You can write code that runs for a long time here, there are no timeouts
    console.log(payload.message);
  },
});

Deployment
----------

Use our SDK to write tasks in your codebase. There's no infrastructure to manage, your tasks automatically scale and connect to our cloud. Or you can always self-host.

Environments
------------

We support `Development`, `Staging`, and `Production` environments, allowing you to test your tasks before deploying them to production.

Full visibility of every job run
--------------------------------

View every task in every run so you can tell exactly what happened. We provide a full trace view of every task run so you can see what happened at every step.
