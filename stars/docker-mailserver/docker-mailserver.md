Docker Mailserver
=================

ðŸ“ƒ About
--------

A production-ready fullstack but simple containerized mail server (SMTP, IMAP, LDAP, Anti-spam, Anti-virus, etc.).

-   Only configuration files, no SQL database. Keep it simple and versioned. Easy to deploy and upgrade.
-   Originally created by @tomav, this project is now maintained by volunteers since January 2021.

Tip

Be sure to read our documentation. It provides guidance on initial setup of your mail server.

Important

If you have issues, please search through the documentation **for your version** before opening an issue.

The issue tracker is for issues, not for personal support.  
Make sure the version of the documentation matches the image version you're using!
