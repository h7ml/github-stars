Tauri + Vue + Vite Template
===========================

Fully configured project template for Tauri and Vue 3 w/ TypeScript and CI.

Features
--------

-   **Vue 3 (TypeScript)** frontend (with devtools)
-   **Vite** configured w/ AutoImport plugin
-   **Vitest** for unit tests
-   **Github Actions** for proper testing / CI pipeline
-   **VS Code** configs for recommended plugins and debugging

Setting Up
----------

1.  Install Tauri Prerequisites
2.  Clone and install dependencies (this template uses `pnpm` by default):

pnpm i

Usage
-----

A Tauri app has at least two processes:

-   the Core Process (`backend`, or _main_ process in Electron terminology), and
-   the WebView process (`frontend`, or _renderer_ in Electron)

### ðŸ¦¢ Frontend (TS, PnPM)

#### Running Development Server

Both back- and frontend start with a single command:

pnpm tauri dev

#### Testing

pnpm test

### ðŸ¦€ Backend (Rust, Cargo)

Backend code lives in `src-tauri/` (Following commands are to be run from there.)

#### Finding Outdated Rust Dependencies

If you have cargo-outdated installed:

cargo outdated

#### Upgrading Rust Dependencies

If you have cargo-edit installed:

cargo upgrade

### Debugging

-   The `dev` command has by default `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` set which makes Rust output full backtraces to the console. (Remove it from the `package.json` command if you don't want it).
-   If you use VS Code, you can debug Rust code with the included `Debug Tauri` config.

### Building and releasing

#### Building

The project has GitHub Actions set up which will automatically test and build your app with every push and PR. For building manually:

pnpm tauri build

#### Releasing a new version

1.  Bump version number by running `pnpm bump [x.y.z]`
2.  Run `pnpm check` to update `Cargo.lock`
3.  Tag the commit you want to release with `vX.Y.Z`
4.  Edit the release notes and push (also tags!)
5.  Github workflow will automatically build a new draft release for this version. Publish when ready ðŸŽ‰
