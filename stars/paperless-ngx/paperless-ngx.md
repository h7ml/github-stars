Paperless-ngx
=============

Paperless-ngx is a document management system that transforms your physical documents into a searchable online archive so you can keep, well, _less paper_.

Paperless-ngx is the official successor to the original Paperless & Paperless-ng projects and is designed to distribute the responsibility of advancing and supporting the project among a team of people. Consider joining us!

Thanks to the generous folks at DigitalOcean, a demo is available at demo.paperless-ngx.com using login `demo` / `demo`. _Note: demo content is reset frequently and confidential information should not be uploaded._

Features
========

A full list of features and screenshots are available in the documentation.

Getting started
===============

The easiest way to deploy paperless is `docker compose`. The files in the `/docker/compose` directory are configured to pull the image from the GitHub container registry.

If you'd like to jump right in, you can configure a `docker compose` environment with our install script:

bash -c "$(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx/main/install-paperless-ngx.sh)"

More details and step-by-step guides for alternative installation methods can be found in the documentation.

Migrating from Paperless-ng is easy, just drop in the new docker image! See the documentation on migrating for more details.

Important Note
==============

> Document scanners are typically used to scan sensitive documents like your social insurance number, tax records, invoices, etc. **Paperless-ngx should never be run on an untrusted host** because information is stored in clear text without encryption. No guarantees are made regarding security (but we do try!) and you use the app at your own risk. **The safest way to run Paperless-ngx is on a local server in your own home with backups in place**.
