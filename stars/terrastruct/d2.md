Quickstart
----------

The most convenient way to use D2 is to just run it as a CLI executable to produce SVGs from `.d2` files.

# First, install D2
curl -fsSL https://d2lang.com/install.sh | sh -s --

echo 'x -> y -> z' \> in.d2
d2 --watch in.d2 out.svg

A browser window will open with `out.svg` and live-reload on changes to `in.d2`.

Install
-------

The easiest way to install is with our install script:

curl -fsSL https://d2lang.com/install.sh | sh -s --

You can run the install script with `--dry-run` to see the commands that will be used to install without executing them.

Or if you have Go installed you can install from source though you won't get the manpage:

go install oss.terrastruct.com/d2@latest

You can also install a release from source which will include manpages. See ./docs/INSTALL.md#source-release.

To uninstall with the install script:

curl -fsSL https://d2lang.com/install.sh | sh -s -- --uninstall

For detailed installation docs, see ./docs/INSTALL.md. We demonstrate alternative methods and examples for each OS.

As well, the functioning of the install script is described in detail to alleviate any concern of its use. We recommend using your OS's package manager directly instead for improved security but the install script is by no means insecure.

D2 as a library
---------------

In addition to being a runnable CLI tool, D2 can also be used to produce diagrams from Go programs.

For examples, see ./docs/examples/lib. This blog post also demos a complete, runnable example of using D2 as a library for a real-world use case.

Themes
------

D2 includes a variety of official themes to style your diagrams beautifully right out of the box. See ./d2themes to browse the available themes and make or contribute your own creation.

Fonts
-----

D2 ships with "Source Sans Pro" as the font in renders. If you wish to use a different one, please see ./d2renderers/d2fonts.

Export file types
-----------------

D2 currently supports SVG, PNG and PDF exports. More coming soon.

Language tooling
----------------

D2 is designed with language tooling in mind. D2's parser can parse multiple errors from a broken program, has an autoformatter, syntax highlighting, and we have plans for LSP's and more. Good language tooling is necessary for creating and maintaining large diagrams.

The extensions for VSCode and Vim can be found in the Related section.

Plugins
-------

D2 is designed to be extensible and composable. The plugin system allows you to change out layout engines and customize the rendering pipeline. Plugins can either be bundled with the build or separately installed as a standalone binary.

**Layout engines**:

-   dagre (default, bundled): A fast, directed graph layout engine that produces layered/hierarchical layouts. Based on Graphviz's DOT algorithm.
-   ELK (bundled): A directed graph layout engine particularly suited for node-link diagrams with an inherent direction and ports.
-   TALA (binary): Novel layout engine designed specifically for software architecture diagrams. Requires separate install, visit the Github page for more.

D2 intends to integrate with a variety of layout engines, e.g. `dot`, as well as single-purpose layout types like sequence diagrams. You can choose whichever layout engine you like and works best for the diagram you're making.
