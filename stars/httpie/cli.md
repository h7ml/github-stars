HTTPie CLI: human-friendly HTTP client for the API era
---------------------------------------------------------

HTTPie (pronounced _aitch-tee-tee-pie_) is a command-line HTTP client. Its goal is to make CLI interaction with web services as human-friendly as possible. HTTPie is designed for testing, debugging, and generally interacting with APIs & HTTP servers. The `http` & `https` commands allow for creating and sending arbitrary HTTP requests. They use simple and natural syntax and provide formatted and colorized output.
