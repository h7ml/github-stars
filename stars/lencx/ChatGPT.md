ChatGPT Desktop Application (Available on Mac, Windows, and Linux)

* * *

Note

**If you want to experience a more powerful AI wrapper application, you can try the Noi (https://github.com/lencx/Noi), which is a successor to the ChatGPT desktop application concept.**

Thank you very much for your interest in this project. OpenAI has now released the macOS version of the application, and a Windows version will be available later (Introducing GPT-4o and more tools to ChatGPT free users). If you prefer the official application, you can stay updated with the latest information from OpenAI.

If you want to learn about or download the previous version (v1.1.0), please click here.

I am currently looking for some differentiating features to develop version 2.0. If you are interested in this, please stay tuned.
