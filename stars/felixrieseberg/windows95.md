=========

This is Windows 95, running in an Electron app. Yes, it's the full thing. I'm sorry.

Does it work?
-------------

Yes! Quite well, actually - on macOS, Windows, and Linux. Bear in mind that this is written entirely in JavaScript, so please adjust your expectations.

Should this have been a native app?
-----------------------------------

Absolutely.

Does it run Doom (or my other favorite game)?
---------------------------------------------

You'll likely be better off with an actual virtualization app, but the short answer is yes. In fact, a few games are already preinstalled - and more can be found on the Internet, for instance at archive.org. Thanks to @DisplacedGamers I can recommend that you switch to a resolution of 640x480 @ 256 colors before starting DOS games - just like in the good ol' days.

99% of the work was done over at v86 by Copy aka Fabian Hemmer and his contributors.

Before you can run this from source, you'll need the disk image. It's not part of the repository, but you can grab it using the `Show Disk Image` button from the packaged release, which does include the disk image. You can find that button in the `Modify C: Drive` section.

Unpack the `images` folder into the `src` folder, creating this layout:

```
- /images/windows95.img
- /images/default-state.bin
- /assets/...
- /bios/...
- /docs/...
```

Once you've done so, run `npm install` and `npm start` to run your local build.

If you want to tinker with the image or make a new one, check out the QEMU docs.
