Erlang/OTP
==========

**Erlang** is a programming language and runtime system for building massively scalable soft real-time systems with requirements on high availability.

**OTP** is a set of Erlang libraries, which consists of the Erlang runtime system, a number of ready-to-use components mainly written in Erlang, and a set of design principles for Erlang programs. Learn more about Erlang and OTP.

Examples
--------

There are several examples on the website to help you get started. The below example defines a function `world/0` that prints "Hello, world" in the Erlang shell:

\-module(hello).
-export(\[world/0\]).

world() \-> io:format("Hello, world\\n").

Save the file as `hello.erl` and run `erl` to enter the Erlang shell to compile the module.

Erlang/OTP 24 \[erts-12.2\] \[source\] \[64-bit\] \[smp:8:8\] \[ds:8:8:10\] \[async-threads:1\] \[jit\]

Eshell V12.2  (abort with ^G)
1> c(hello).
{ok,hello}
2> hello:world().
Hello, world
ok
