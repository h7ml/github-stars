A javascript framework for front-end microservices
--------------------------------------------------

Build micro frontends that coexist and can (but don't need to) be written with their own framework. This allows you to:

-   Use multiple frameworks on the same page without refreshing the page (React, AngularJS, Angular, Ember, or whatever you're using)
-   Write new code, possibly with a new framework, without rewriting your existing app
-   Lazy load code for improved initial load time.
