Waifu Motivator Plugin
----------------------

A collection of open-sourced Jetbrains IDE plugins that bring _Waifus_ in to help keep your motivation to complete during your coding challenges.

**What is a Waifu?** ðŸ¤·

> _Waifu_ is a term for a fictional character, usually in anime or related media, that someone has great, and sometimes romantic, affection for. source

Installation
------------

To install the plugin, go to `Settings | Plugins | Marketplace Tab | Search for 'Waifu Motivator'`. You can install it from the plugin marketplace.

Configuration
-------------

To configure the plugin, go to `Settings | Other Settings | Waifu Motivator`

Waifu of the Day
----------------

Why would you want the _Tip of the Day_, when instead you can have a _Waifu of the Day_? This feature replaces the out-of-the-box Tip of the Day feature of IntelliJ with a top-tier _Waifu_!

_This only shows up once a day at the project startup, and you can also view it at the 'Waifu Motivator' tool menu._

Anime Memes (AMII)
------------------

Since Waifu Motivator `v2.0`, the AMII plugin now handles the notification events. This includes not only Waifus, it has anything you can think of within the anime space!

Give your IDE more personality and have more fun programming with the **A**nime **M**eme **I**DE **I**ntegration! (AMII)  
  
Upon installation, our Meme Inference Knowledge Unit (or MIKU for short) will begin interact with you as you build code. MIKU knows when your programs fail to run or tests pass/fail. Your new companion has the ability to react to these events. Which will most likely take the form of an anime meme of your: waifu, husbando, and/or favorite character(s)!  
  

Please see AMII's feature documentation for more information.

Doki-Theme Integration
----------------------

You can also install Doki Theme to have a better _Waifu_ development experience!
