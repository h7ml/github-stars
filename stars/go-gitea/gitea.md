Gitea

Purpose
-------

The goal of this project is to make the easiest, fastest, and most painless way of setting up a self-hosted Git service.

As Gitea is written in Go, it works across **all** the platforms and architectures that are supported by Go, including Linux, macOS, and Windows on x86, amd64, ARM and PowerPC architectures. This project has been forked from Gogs since November of 2016, but a lot has changed.

For online demonstrations, you can visit demo.gitea.com.

For accessing free Gitea service (with a limited number of repositories), you can visit gitea.com.

To quickly deploy your own dedicated Gitea instance on Gitea Cloud, you can start a free trial at cloud.gitea.com.

Documentation
-------------

You can find comprehensive documentation on our official documentation website.

It includes installation, administration, usage, development, contributing guides, and more to help you get started and explore all features effectively.

If you have any suggestions or would like to contribute to it, you can visit the documentation repository

Building
--------

From the root of the source tree, run:

```
TAGS="bindata" make build
```

or if SQLite support is required:

```
TAGS="bindata sqlite sqlite_unlock_notify" make build
```

The `build` target is split into two sub-targets:

-   `make backend` which requires Go Stable, the required version is defined in go.mod.
-   `make frontend` which requires Node.js LTS or greater.

Internet connectivity is required to download the go and npm modules. When building from the official source tarballs which include pre-built frontend files, the `frontend` target will not be triggered, making it possible to build without Node.js.

More info: https://docs.gitea.com/installation/install-from-source

Using
-----

After building, a binary file named `gitea` will be generated in the root of the source tree by default. To run it, use:

```
./gitea web
```

Note

If you're interested in using our APIs, we have experimental support with documentation.

Contributing
------------

Expected workflow is: Fork -> Patch -> Push -> Pull Request

Note

1.  **YOU MUST READ THE CONTRIBUTORS GUIDE BEFORE STARTING TO WORK ON A PULL REQUEST.**
2.  If you have found a vulnerability in the project, please write privately to **security@gitea.io**. Thanks!

Translating
-----------

Translations are done through Crowdin. If you want to translate to a new language ask one of the managers in the Crowdin project to add a new language there.

You can also just create an issue for adding a language or ask on discord on the #translation channel. If you need context or find some translation issues, you can leave a comment on the string or ask on Discord. For general translation questions there is a section in the docs. Currently a bit empty but we hope to fill it as questions pop up.

Get more information from documentation.

Official and Third-Party Projects
---------------------------------

We provide an official go-sdk, a CLI tool called tea and an action runner for Gitea Action.

We maintain a list of Gitea-related projects at gitea/awesome-gitea, where you can discover more third-party projects, including SDKs, plugins, themes, and more.

Communication
-------------

If you have questions that are not covered by the documentation, you can get in contact with us on our Discord server or create a post in the discourse forum.
