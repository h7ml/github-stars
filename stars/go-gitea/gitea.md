Gitea

Purpose
-------

The goal of this project is to make the easiest, fastest, and most painless way of setting up a self-hosted Git service.

As Gitea is written in Go, it works across **all** the platforms and architectures that are supported by Go, including Linux, macOS, and Windows on x86, amd64, ARM and PowerPC architectures. This project has been forked from Gogs since November of 2016, but a lot has changed.

For online demonstrations, you can visit demo.gitea.com.

For accessing free Gitea service (with a limited number of repositories), you can visit gitea.com.

To quickly deploy your own dedicated Gitea instance on Gitea Cloud, you can start a free trial at cloud.gitea.com.

Building
--------

From the root of the source tree, run:

```
TAGS="bindata" make build
```

or if SQLite support is required:

```
TAGS="bindata sqlite sqlite_unlock_notify" make build
```

The `build` target is split into two sub-targets:

-   `make backend` which requires Go Stable, the required version is defined in go.mod.
-   `make frontend` which requires Node.js LTS or greater.

Internet connectivity is required to download the go and npm modules. When building from the official source tarballs which include pre-built frontend files, the `frontend` target will not be triggered, making it possible to build without Node.js.

Translating
-----------

Translations are done through Crowdin. If you want to translate to a new language ask one of the managers in the Crowdin project to add a new language there.

You can also just create an issue for adding a language or ask on discord on the #translation channel. If you need context or find some translation issues, you can leave a comment on the string or ask on Discord. For general translation questions there is a section in the docs. Currently a bit empty but we hope to fill it as questions pop up.
