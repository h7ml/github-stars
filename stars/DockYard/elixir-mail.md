Mail
====

An RFC2822 implementation in Elixir, built for composability.

**Mail is built and maintained by DockYard, contact us for expert Elixir and Phoenix consulting**.

Installation
------------

def deps do
  \[
    \# Get from hex
    {:mail, "~> 0.4"},

    \# Or use the latest from master
    {:mail, github: "DockYard/elixir-mail"}
  \]
end

Building
--------

You can quickly build an RFC2822 spec compliant message.

#### Single-Part

message \=
  Mail.build()
  |> Mail.put\_text("A great message")
  |> Mail.put\_to("bob@example.com")
  |> Mail.put\_from("me@example.com")
  |> Mail.put\_subject("Open me")

#### Multi-Part

message \=
  Mail.build\_multipart()
  |> Mail.put\_text("Hello there!")
  |> Mail.put\_html("<h1>Hello there!</h1>")
  |> Mail.put\_attachment("path/to/README.md")
  |> Mail.put\_attachment({"README.md", file\_data})

Rendering
---------

After you have built your message you can render it:

rendered\_message \= Mail.render(message)

Parsing
-------

If you'd like to parse an already rendered message back into a data model:

%Mail.Message{} \= message \= Mail.parse(rendered\_message)

There are more functions described in the docs
