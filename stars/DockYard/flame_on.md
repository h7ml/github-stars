Flame On
========

Add Flame Graphs to your Phoenix Application or LiveDashboard

Getting Started
---------------

For more information on flame graphs and an introduction to Flame On, see the announcement blog post

Installation
------------

Add `:flame_on` to your dependencies:

def deps do
  \[
    {:flame\_on, "~> 0.7.0"}
  \]
end

And then add Flame On as a LiveDashboard page or a LiveComponent in your LiveView page

### Flame On as a LiveDashboard page

Modify the `live_dashboard` call in your `Router`:

live\_dashboard "/dashboard",
  metrics: MyAppWeb.Telemetry,
  additional\_pages: \[
    flame\_on: FlameOn.DashboardPage
  \]

You will now find a `Flame On` tab along the top of the LiveDashboard page

### Flame On as a LiveComponent in your own LiveView page

<.live\_component module\={FlameOn.Component} id\="flame\_on" width\="100%" height\="100%" /\>

Usage
-----

Choose the Module, Function, and Arity of the function you want to profile, click "Flame On", and then trigger the function (e.g. make a web request in a new tab). Note that for Elixir modules, you will need to prefix them with `Elixir`, e.g. `Elixir.Phoenix.Controller`, while Erlang modules take simply the erlang module name, e.g. `cowboy_handler`. The default values of `Bandit.Pipeline`/`run`/`4` (for newer Phoenix apps) and `cowboy_handler`/`execute`/`2` (for older Phoenix apps) are the best way to capture a standard Phoenix Controller DeadView request or the DeadView request that kicks off a LiveView request.

### Zooming

Clicking a block will zoom the flamegraph to that block and recalculate the percents for the blocks such that the clicked block is now 100%. You can return to a higher level block by clicking the link for it above the blocks.

Running in Production
---------------------

Flame On should not be run in critical production environments. Flame On uses `:meck` under the hood. This swaps out beam code paths and injects mock code that includes tracing. If you do need to use Flame On in a critical production node to diagnose a specific issue, I recommend rebuilding or restarting that node after running it.

Running in a Release
--------------------

`:meck` swaps out code paths and therefore you will need to include the beam files in your release. By default these are stripped, so in your release definition in `mix.exs` add the `strip_beams: false` flag:

releases: \[
  my\_app\_web: \[
    ...
    strip\_beams: false
  \],

You may also need to explicitly include `:meck` as a dependency if it can't find it when trying to run in a release.
