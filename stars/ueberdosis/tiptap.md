Tiptap Editor
=============

The Tiptap Editor is a headless, framework-agnostic rich text editor that's customizable and extendable through extensions. Its headless nature means it comes without a set user interface, offering full design freedom (for a jumpstart, see linked UI templates below). Tiptap is based on the highly reliable ProseMirror library.

Tiptap Editor is complemented by the collaboration open-source backend Hocuspocus. Both the Editor and Hocuspocus form the foundation of the Tiptap Suite.

### How does the Tiptap Editor work?

-   **Headless Framework:** Tiptap does not rely on a user interface. So there is no need for class overrides or code hacks. If you do need an example UI feel free to browse our UI templates linked below.
-   **Framework-agnostic:** The Tiptap Editor is designed to work across different frontend frameworks. This means whether you're using Vue, React, or plain JavaScript, Tiptap integrates without compatibility issues.
-   **Extension based:** Extensions in Tiptap allow for a tailored editing experience, from simple text styling to advanced features like drag-and-drop block editing. You have the option to choose from over 100 extensions available in the documentation and community to enhance your editor's functionality.
-   **Customize your UX:** The editor was built to give you control to define your own extensions and nodes.

### Editor Pro Extensions

The **Pro Extensions** are a set of advanced functionalities that enhance the capabilities of the Tiptap Editor. They are additional features that can be integrated into the base editor to provide more sophisticated editing options.

Key functionalities include collaborative editing, which allows multiple users to edit documents simultaneously, drag-and-drop file management for easier handling of documents and media, and unique node ID assignment. Review the docs right here.

Pro Extensions are free with a Tiptap account. Once signed up, review the guide in your account.
