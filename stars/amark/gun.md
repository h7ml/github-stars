**GUN** is an ecosystem of **tools** that let you build community run and encrypted applications - like an Open Source Firebase or a Decentralized Dropbox.

The Internet Archive and 100s of other apps run GUN in-production.

-   Multiplayer by default with realtime p2p state synchronization!
-   Graph data lets you use key/value, tables, documents, videos, & more!
-   Local-first, offline, and decentralized with end-to-end encryption.

Decentralized alternatives to Zoom, Reddit, Instagram, Slack, YouTube, Stripe, Wikipedia, Facebook Horizon and more have already pushed terabytes of daily P2P traffic on GUN. We are a friendly community creating a free fun future for freedom:

Quickstart
----------

GUN is _super easy_ to get started with:

-   Try the interactive tutorial in the browser (**5min** ~ average developer).
-   Or `npm install gun` and run the examples with `cd node_modules/gun && npm start` (**5min** ~ average developer).

> **Note:** If you don't have node or npm, read this first. If the `npm` command line didn't work, you may need to `mkdir node_modules` first or use `sudo`.

-   An online demo of the examples are available here: http://try.axe.eco/
-   Or write a quick app: (try now in a playground)

<script src\="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/gun/gun.js"\></script\>
<script\>
// import GUN from 'gun'; // in ESM
// GUN = require('gun'); // in NodeJS
// GUN = require('gun/gun'); // in React
gun \= GUN();

gun.get('mark').put({
  name: "Mark",
  email: "mark@gun.eco",
});

gun.get('mark').on((data, key) \=> {
  console.log("realtime updates:", data);
});

setInterval(() \=> { gun.get('mark').get('live').put(Math.random()) }, 9);
</script\>

-   Or try something **mind blowing**, like saving circular references to a table of documents! (play)

cat \= {name: "Fluffy", species: "kitty"};
mark \= {boss: cat};
cat.slave \= mark;

// partial updates merge with existing data!
gun.get('mark').put(mark);

// access the data as if it is a document.
gun.get('mark').get('boss').get('name').once(function(data, key){
  // \`once\` grabs the data once, no subscriptions.
  console.log("Mark's boss is", data);
});

// traverse a graph of circular references!
gun.get('mark').get('boss').get('slave').once(function(data, key){
  console.log("Mark is the cat's slave!", data);
});

// add both of them to a table!
gun.get('list').set(gun.get('mark').get('boss'));
gun.get('list').set(gun.get('mark'));

// grab each item once from the table, continuously:
gun.get('list').map().once(function(data, key){
  console.log("Item:", data);
});

// live update the table!
gun.get('list').set({type: "cucumber", goal: "jumping cat"});

About
=====

First & foremost, GUN is **a community of the nicest and most helpful people** out there. So I want to invite you to come tell us about what **you** are working on & wanting to build (new or old school alike! Just be nice as well.) and ask us your questions directly. :)

  
Watch the 100 second intro!

The GUN ecosystem stack is a collection of independent and modular tools covering everything from CRDT conflict resolution, cryptographic security & encryption, radix storage serialization, mesh networking & routing algorithms, to distributed systems correctness & load testing, CPU scheduled JSON parser to prevent UI lag, and more!

On that note, let's get some official shout outs covered first:

### History

GUN was created by Mark Nadal in 2014 after he had spent 4 years trying to get his collaborative web app to scale up with traditional databases.

After he realized Master-Slave database architecture causes one big bottleneck, he (as a complete newbie outsider) naively decided **to question the status quo** and shake things up with controversial, heretical, and contrarian experiments:

**The NoDB** - no master, no servers, no "single source of truth", not built with a real programming language or real hardware, no DevOps, no locking, not _just_ SQL or NoSQL but both (**all** - graphs, documents, tables, key/value).

The goal was to build a P2P database that could survive living inside **any** browser, and could correctly sync data between **any** device after assuming **any** offline-first activity.

Technically, **GUN is a graph synchronization protocol** with a _lightweight embedded engine_, capable of doing _20M+ API ops/sec_ in **just ~9KB gzipped size**.

I am missing many others, apologies, will be adding them soon! This list is infinitely old & way out of date, if you want to be listed in it please make a PR! :)

Testing
-------

You will need to `npm install -g mocha` first. Then in the gun root folder run `npm test`. Tests will trigger persistent writes to the DB, so subsequent runs of the test will fail. You must clear the DB before running the tests again. This can be done by running `rm -rf *data*` command in the project directory.

Shims
-----

> These are only needed for NodeJS & React Native, they shim the native Browser WebCrypto API.

If you want to use SEA for `User` auth and security, you will need to install:

`npm install @peculiar/webcrypto --save`

Please see our React Native docs for installation instructions!

Then you can require SEA without an error:

GUN \= require('gun/gun');
SEA \= require('gun/sea');

Deploy
------

> Note: The default examples that get auto-deployed on `npm start` CDN-ify all GUN files, modules, & storage.

> Note: Moving forward, AXE will start to automatically cluster your peer into a shared DHT. You may want to disable this to run an isolated network.

> Note: When deploying a web application using GUN on a cloud provider, you may have to set `CI=false` in your `.env`. This prevents GUN-specific warnings from being treated as errors when deploying your app. You may also resolve this by modifying your webpack config to not try to build the GUN dependencies.

To quickly spin up a GUN relay peer for your development team, utilize Heroku, Docker, or any others listed below. Or some variant thereof Dokku, K8s, etc. ! Or use all of them so your relays are decentralized too!

### Linux

`SSH` into the home directory of a clean OS install with `sudo` ability. Set any environment variables you need (see below), then do:

curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amark/gun/master/examples/install.sh | bash

> Read install.sh first! If `curl` is not found, _copy&paste_ the contents of install.sh into your ssh.

You can now safely `CTRL+A+D` to escape without stopping the peer. To stop everything `killall screen` or `killall node`.

Environment variables may need to be set like `export HTTPS_CERT=~/cert.pem HTTPS_KEY=~/key.pem PORT=443`. You can also look at a sample nginx config. For production deployments, you probably will want to use something like `pm2` or better to keep the peer alive after machine reboots.

### Dome

Deploy GUN in one-click with Dome and receive a free trial:

### Heroku

> Heroku deletes your data every 15 minutes, one way to fix this is by adding cheap storage.

Or:

git clone https://github.com/amark/gun.git
cd gun
heroku create
git push -f heroku HEAD:master

Then visit the URL in the output of the 'heroku create' step, in a browser. Make sure to set any environment config vars in the settings tab.

### Zeet.co

Then visit the URL in the output of the 'now --npm' step, in your browser.

### Docker

> Warning: Docker image is community contributed and may be old with missing security updates, please check version numbers to compare.

Pull from the Docker Hub . Or:

docker run -p 8765:8765 gundb/gun

Or build the Docker image locally:

git clone https://github.com/amark/gun.git
cd gun
docker build -t myrepo/gundb:v1 .
docker run -p 8765:8765 myrepo/gundb:v1

Or, if you prefer your Docker image with metadata labels (Linux/Mac only):

npm run docker
docker run -p 8765:8765 username/gun:git

Then visit http://localhost:8765 in your browser.
