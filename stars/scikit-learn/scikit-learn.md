**scikit-learn** is a Python module for machine learning built on top of SciPy and is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

The project was started in 2007 by David Cournapeau as a Google Summer of Code project, and since then many volunteers have contributed. See the About us page for a list of core contributors.

It is currently maintained by a team of volunteers.

Installation
------------

### Dependencies

scikit-learn requires:

-   Python (>= 3.10)
-   NumPy (>= 1.22.0)
-   SciPy (>= 1.8.0)
-   joblib (>= 1.2.0)
-   threadpoolctl (>= 3.1.0)

* * *

Scikit-learn plotting capabilities (i.e., functions start with `plot_` and classes end with `Display`) require Matplotlib (>= 3.5.0). For running the examples Matplotlib >= 3.5.0 is required. A few examples require scikit-image >= 0.19.0, a few examples require pandas >= 1.4.0, some examples require seaborn >= 0.9.0 and plotly >= 5.14.0.

### User installation

If you already have a working installation of NumPy and SciPy, the easiest way to install scikit-learn is using `pip`:

pip install -U scikit-learn

or `conda`:

conda install -c conda-forge scikit-learn

The documentation includes more detailed installation instructions.
