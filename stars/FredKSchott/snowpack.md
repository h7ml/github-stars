Snowpack
========

Snowpack is a lightning-fast frontend build tool, designed to leverage JavaScript's native module system (known as ESM). It is an alternative to heavier, more complex bundlers like webpack or Parcel in your development workflow.

### Key Features

-   Develop faster, with a dev server that starts up in **50ms or less.**
-   See changes reflected instantly in the browser.
-   Integrate your favorite bundler for a production-optimized build.
-   Enjoy out-of-the-box support for TypeScript, JSX, CSS Modules and more.
-   Connect your favorite tools with third-party plugins.
