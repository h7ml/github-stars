Contributions
=============

Contributions are very welcome! It helps me know what features are desired or what bugs are causing the most pain.

I have just one request; If you submit a pull request for a bugfix, please add a unit-test or integration-test (in the spec folder) that catches the problem. Even a PR that just has a failing test is fine - I can analyse what the test is doing and fix the code from that.

Note: Please try to avoid modifying the package version in a PR. Versions are updated on release and any change will most likely result in merge collisions.

To be clear, all contributions added to this library will be included in the library's MIT licence.

Importing⬆
==========

const ExcelJS \= require('exceljs');

ES5 Imports⬆
------------

To use the ES5 transpiled code, for example for node.js versions older than 10, use the dist/es5 path.

const ExcelJS \= require('exceljs/dist/es5');

**Note:** The ES5 build has an implicit dependency on a number of polyfills which are no longer explicitly added by exceljs. You will need to add "core-js" and "regenerator-runtime" to your dependencies and include the following requires in your code before the exceljs import:

// polyfills required by exceljs
require('core-js/modules/es.promise');
require('core-js/modules/es.string.includes');
require('core-js/modules/es.object.assign');
require('core-js/modules/es.object.keys');
require('core-js/modules/es.symbol');
require('core-js/modules/es.symbol.async-iterator');
require('regenerator-runtime/runtime');

const ExcelJS \= require('exceljs/dist/es5');

For IE 11, you'll also need a polyfill to support unicode regex patterns. For example,

const rewritePattern \= require('regexpu-core');
const {generateRegexpuOptions} \= require('@babel/helper-create-regexp-features-plugin/lib/util');

const {RegExp} \= global;
try {
  new RegExp('a', 'u');
} catch (err) {
  global.RegExp \= function(pattern, flags) {
    if (flags && flags.includes('u')) {
      return new RegExp(rewritePattern(pattern, flags, generateRegexpuOptions({flags, pattern})));
    }
    return new RegExp(pattern, flags);
  };
  global.RegExp.prototype \= RegExp.prototype;
}

Browserify⬆
-----------

ExcelJS publishes two browserified bundles inside the dist/ folder:

One with implicit dependencies on core-js polyfills...

<script src\="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-polyfill/6.26.0/polyfill.js"\></script\>
<script src\="exceljs.js"\></script\>

And one without...

<script src\="\--your-project's-pollyfills-here--"\></script\>
<script src\="exceljs.bare.js"\></script\>

Interface⬆
==========

Create a Workbook⬆
------------------

const workbook \= new ExcelJS.Workbook();

Set Workbook Properties⬆
------------------------

workbook.creator \= 'Me';
workbook.lastModifiedBy \= 'Her';
workbook.created \= new Date(1985, 8, 30);
workbook.modified \= new Date();
workbook.lastPrinted \= new Date(2016, 9, 27);

// Set workbook dates to 1904 date system
workbook.properties.date1904 \= true;

Set Calculation Properties⬆
---------------------------

// Force workbook calculation on load
workbook.calcProperties.fullCalcOnLoad \= true;

Workbook Views⬆
---------------

The Workbook views controls how many separate windows Excel will open when viewing the workbook.

workbook.views \= \[
  {
    x: 0, y: 0, width: 10000, height: 20000,
    firstSheet: 0, activeTab: 1, visibility: 'visible'
  }
\]

Add a Worksheet⬆
----------------

const sheet \= workbook.addWorksheet('My Sheet');

Use the second parameter of the addWorksheet function to specify options for the worksheet.

For Example:

// create a sheet with red tab colour
const sheet \= workbook.addWorksheet('My Sheet', {properties:{tabColor:{argb:'FFC0000'}}});

// create a sheet where the grid lines are hidden
const sheet \= workbook.addWorksheet('My Sheet', {views: \[{showGridLines: false}\]});

// create a sheet with the first row and column frozen
const sheet \= workbook.addWorksheet('My Sheet', {views:\[{state: 'frozen', xSplit: 1, ySplit:1}\]});

// Create worksheets with headers and footers
const sheet \= workbook.addWorksheet('My Sheet', {
  headerFooter:{firstHeader: "Hello Exceljs", firstFooter: "Hello World"}
});

// create new sheet with pageSetup settings for A4 - landscape
const worksheet \=  workbook.addWorksheet('My Sheet', {
  pageSetup:{paperSize: 9, orientation:'landscape'}
});

Remove a Worksheet⬆
-------------------

Use the worksheet `id` to remove the sheet from workbook.

For Example:

// Create a worksheet
const sheet \= workbook.addWorksheet('My Sheet');

// Remove the worksheet using worksheet id
workbook.removeWorksheet(sheet.id)

Access Worksheets⬆
------------------

// Iterate over all sheets
// Note: workbook.worksheets.forEach will still work but this is better
workbook.eachSheet(function(worksheet, sheetId) {
  // ...
});

// fetch sheet by name
const worksheet \= workbook.getWorksheet('My Sheet');

// fetch sheet by id
// INFO: Be careful when using it!
// It tries to access to \`worksheet.id\` field. Sometimes (really very often) workbook has worksheets with id not starting from 1.
// For instance It happens when any worksheet has been deleted.
// It's much more safety when you assume that ids are random. And stop to use this function.
// If you need to access all worksheets in a loop please look to the next example.
const worksheet \= workbook.getWorksheet(1);

// access by \`worksheets\` array:
workbook.worksheets\[0\]; //the first one;

It's important to know that `workbook.getWorksheet(1) != Workbook.worksheets[0]` and `workbook.getWorksheet(1) != Workbook.worksheets[1]`, because `workbook.worksheets[0].id` may have any value.

Worksheet State⬆
----------------

// make worksheet visible
worksheet.state \= 'visible';

// make worksheet hidden
worksheet.state \= 'hidden';

// make worksheet hidden from 'hide/unhide' dialog
worksheet.state \= 'veryHidden';

Worksheet Properties⬆
---------------------

Worksheets support a property bucket to allow control over some features of the worksheet.

// create new sheet with properties
const worksheet \= workbook.addWorksheet('sheet', {properties:{tabColor:{argb:'FF00FF00'}}});

// create a new sheet writer with properties
const worksheetWriter \= workbookWriter.addWorksheet('sheet', {properties:{outlineLevelCol:1}});

// adjust properties afterwards (not supported by worksheet-writer)
worksheet.properties.outlineLevelCol \= 2;
worksheet.properties.defaultRowHeight \= 15;

Page Setup⬆
-----------

All properties that can affect the printing of a sheet are held in a pageSetup object on the sheet.

// create new sheet with pageSetup settings for A4 - landscape
const worksheet \=  workbook.addWorksheet('sheet', {
  pageSetup:{paperSize: 9, orientation:'landscape'}
});

// create a new sheet writer with pageSetup settings for fit-to-page
const worksheetWriter \= workbookWriter.addWorksheet('sheet', {
  pageSetup:{fitToPage: true, fitToHeight: 5, fitToWidth: 7}
});

// adjust pageSetup settings afterwards
worksheet.pageSetup.margins \= {
  left: 0.7, right: 0.7,
  top: 0.75, bottom: 0.75,
  header: 0.3, footer: 0.3
};

// Set Print Area for a sheet
worksheet.pageSetup.printArea \= 'A1:G20';

// Set multiple Print Areas by separating print areas with '&&'
worksheet.pageSetup.printArea \= 'A1:G10&&A11:G20';

Worksheet Views⬆
----------------

Worksheets now support a list of views, that control how Excel presents the sheet:

-   frozen - where a number of rows and columns to the top and left are frozen in place. Only the bottom right section will scroll
-   split - where the view is split into 4 sections, each semi-independently scrollable.

Each view also supports various properties:

Name

Default

Description

\];

Auto filters⬆
-------------

It is possible to apply an auto filter to your worksheet.

worksheet.autoFilter \= 'A1:C1';

While the range string is the standard form of the autoFilter, the worksheet will also support the following values:

// Set an auto filter from A1 to C1
worksheet.autoFilter \= {
  from: 'A1',
  to: 'C1',
}

// Set an auto filter from the cell in row 3 and column 1
// to the cell in row 5 and column 12
worksheet.autoFilter \= {
  from: {
    row: 3,
    column: 1
  },
  to: {
    row: 5,
    column: 12
  }
}

// Set an auto filter from D3 to the
// cell in row 7 and column 5
worksheet.autoFilter \= {
  from: 'D3',
  to: {
    row: 7,
    column: 5
  }
}

Columns⬆
--------

// Add column headers and define column keys and widths
// Note: these column structures are a workbook-building convenience only,
// apart from the column width, they will not be fully persisted.
worksheet.columns \= \[
  { header: 'Id', key: 'id', width: 10 },
  { header: 'Name', key: 'name', width: 32 },
  { header: 'D.O.B.', key: 'DOB', width: 10, outlineLevel: 1 }
\];

// Access an individual columns by key, letter and 1-based column number
const idCol \= worksheet.getColumn('id');
const nameCol \= worksheet.getColumn('B');
const dobCol \= worksheet.getColumn(3);

// set column properties

// Note: will overwrite cell value C1
dobCol.header \= 'Date of Birth';

// Note: this will overwrite cell values C1:C2
dobCol.header \= \['Date of Birth', 'A.K.A. D.O.B.'\];

// from this point on, this column will be indexed by 'dob' and not 'DOB'
dobCol.key \= 'dob';

dobCol.width \= 15;

// Hide the column if you'd like
dobCol.hidden \= true;

// set an outline level for columns
worksheet.getColumn(4).outlineLevel \= 0;
worksheet.getColumn(5).outlineLevel \= 1;

// columns support a readonly field to indicate the collapsed state based on outlineLevel
expect(worksheet.getColumn(4).collapsed).to.equal(false);
expect(worksheet.getColumn(5).collapsed).to.equal(true);

// iterate over all current cells in this column
dobCol.eachCell(function(cell, rowNumber) {
  // ...
});

// iterate over all current cells in this column including empty cells
dobCol.eachCell({ includeEmpty: true }, function(cell, rowNumber) {
  // ...
});

// add a column of new values
worksheet.getColumn(6).values \= \[1,2,3,4,5\];

// add a sparse column of values
worksheet.getColumn(7).values \= \[,,2,3,,5,,7,,,,11\];

// cut one or more columns (columns to the right are shifted left)
// If column properties have been defined, they will be cut or moved accordingly
// Known Issue: If a splice causes any merged cells to move, the results may be unpredictable
worksheet.spliceColumns(3,2);

// remove one column and insert two more.
// Note: columns 4 and above will be shifted right by 1 column.
// Also: If the worksheet has more rows than values in the column inserts,
//  the rows will still be shifted as if the values existed
const newCol3Values \= \[1,2,3,4,5\];
const newCol4Values \= \['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five'\];
worksheet.spliceColumns(3, 1, newCol3Values, newCol4Values);

Rows⬆
-----

// Get a row object. If it doesn't already exist, a new empty one will be returned
const row \= worksheet.getRow(5);

// remove a name from a cell
worksheet.getCell('A1').removeName('thing1');
expect(worksheet.getCell('A1').names).to.have.members(\['thing2'\]);

Tables⬆
-------

Tables allow for in-sheet manipulation of tabular data.

To add a table to a worksheet, define a table model and call addTable:

// add a table to a sheet
ws.addTable({
  name: 'MyTable',
  ref: 'A1',
  headerRow: true,
  totalsRow: true,
  style: {
    theme: 'TableStyleDark3',
    showRowStripes: true,
  },
  columns: \[
    {name: 'Date', totalsRowLabel: 'Totals:', filterButton: true},
    {name: 'Amount', totalsRowFunction: 'sum', filterButton: false},
  \],
  rows: \[
    \[new Date('2019-07-20'), 70.10\],
    \[new Date('2019-07-21'), 70.60\],
    \[new Date('2019-07-22'), 70.10\],
  \],
});

Note: Adding a table to a worksheet will modify the sheet by placing headers and row data to the sheet. Any data on the sheet covered by the resulting table (including headers and totals) will be overwritten.

Shades, Numbers can be one of:

-   Light, 1-21
-   Medium, 1-28
-   Dark, 1-11

For no theme, use the value null.

Note: custom table themes are not supported by exceljs yet.

### Modifying Tables⬆

Tables support a set of manipulation functions that allow data to be added or removed and some properties to be changed. Since many of these operations may have on-sheet effects, the changes must be committed once complete.

All index values in the table are zero based, so the first row number and first column number is 0.

**Adding or Removing Headers and Totals**

const table \= ws.getTable('MyTable');

// turn header row on
table.headerRow \= true;

// turn totals row off
table.totalsRow \= false;

// commit the table changes into the sheet
table.commit();

**Relocating a Table**

const table \= ws.getTable('MyTable');

// table top-left move to D4
table.ref \= 'D4';

// commit the table changes into the sheet
table.commit();

**Adding and Removing Rows**

const table \= ws.getTable('MyTable');

// remove first two rows
table.removeRows(0, 2);

// insert new rows at index 5
table.addRow(\[new Date('2019-08-05'), 5, 'Mid'\], 5);

// append new row to bottom of table
table.addRow(\[new Date('2019-08-10'), 10, 'End'\]);

// commit the table changes into the sheet
table.commit();

**Adding and Removing Columns**

const table \= ws.getTable('MyTable');

// remove second column
table.removeColumns(1, 1);

// insert new column (with data) at index 1
table.addColumn(
  {name: 'Letter', totalsRowFunction: 'custom', totalsRowFormula: 'ROW()', totalsRowResult: 6, filterButton: true},
  \['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'\],
  2
);

// commit the table changes into the sheet
table.commit();

**Change Column Properties**

const table \= ws.getTable('MyTable');

// Get Column Wrapper for second column
const column \= table.getColumn(1);

// set some properties
column.name \= 'Code';
column.filterButton \= true;
column.style \= {font:{bold: true, name: 'Comic Sans MS'}};
column.totalsRowLabel \= 'Totals';
column.totalsRowFunction \= 'custom';
column.totalsRowFormula \= 'ROW()';
column.totalsRowResult \= 10;

// commit the table changes into the sheet
table.commit();

Styles⬆
-------

Cells, Rows and Columns each support a rich set of styles and formats that affect how the cells are displayed.

Styles are set by assigning the following properties:

-   numFmt
-   font
-   alignment
-   border
-   fill

// assign a style to a cell
ws.getCell('A1').numFmt \= '0.00%';

// Apply styles to worksheet columns
ws.columns \= \[
  { header: 'Id', key: 'id', width: 10 },
  { header: 'Name', key: 'name', width: 32, style: { font: { name: 'Arial Black' } } },
  { header: 'D.O.B.', key: 'DOB', width: 10, style: { numFmt: 'dd/mm/yyyy' } }
\];

// Set Column 3 to Currency Format
ws.getColumn(3).numFmt \= '"£"#,##0.00;\[Red\]\\-"£"#,##0.00';

// Set Row 2 to Comic Sans.
ws.getRow(2).font \= { name: 'Comic Sans MS', family: 4, size: 16, underline: 'double', bold: true };

When a style is applied to a row or column, it will be applied to all currently existing cells in that row or column. Also, any new cell that is created will inherit its initial styles from the row and column it belongs to.

If a cell's row and column both define a specific style (e.g. font), the cell will use the row style over the column style. However if the row and column define different styles (e.g. column.numFmt and row.font), the cell will inherit the font from the row and the numFmt from the column.

Caveat: All the above properties (with the exception of numFmt, which is a string), are JS object structures. If the same style object is assigned to more than one spreadsheet entity, then each entity will share the same style object. If the style object is later modified before the spreadsheet is serialized, then all entities referencing that style object will be modified too. This behaviour is intended to prioritize performance by reducing the number of JS objects created. If you want the style objects to be independent, you will need to clone them before assigning them. Also, by default, when a document is read from file (or stream) if spreadsheet entities share similar styles, then they will reference the same style object too.

### Number Formats⬆

// display value as '1 3/5'
ws.getCell('A1').value \= 1.6;
ws.getCell('A1').numFmt \= '# ?/?';

// display value as '1.60%'
ws.getCell('B1').value \= 0.016;
ws.getCell('B1').numFmt \= '0.00%';

### Fonts⬆

// for the wannabe graphic designers out there
ws.getCell('A1').font \= {
  name: 'Comic Sans MS',
  family: 4,
  size: 16,
  underline: true,
  bold: true
};

// for the graduate graphic designers...
ws.getCell('A2').font \= {
  name: 'Arial Black',
  color: { argb: 'FF00FF00' },
  family: 2,
  size: 14,
  italic: true
};

// for the vertical align
ws.getCell('A3').font \= {
  vertAlign: 'superscript'
};

// note: the cell will store a reference to the font object assigned.
// If the font object is changed afterwards, the cell font will change also...
const font \= { name: 'Arial', size: 12 };
ws.getCell('A3').font \= font;
font.size \= 20; // Cell A3 now has font size 20!

// Cells that share similar fonts may reference the same font object after
// the workbook is read from file or stream

    {position:0, color:{argb:'FFFF0000'}},
    {position:1, color:{argb:'FF00FF00'}}
  \]
};

#### Pattern Fills⬆

Property

Required

Description

type

Y

Value: 'pattern'  
Specifies this fill uses patterns

pattern

Y

Specifies type of pattern (see Valid Pattern Types below)

fgColor

N

Specifies the pattern foreground color. Default is black.

bgColor

N

Specifies the pattern background color. Default is white.

Note: If you want to fill a cell using the `solid` pattern, then you don't need to specify `bgColor`. See example above for cell `A3` with a `solid` pattern and a coral `fgColor`.

**Valid Pattern Types**

-   none
-   solid
-   darkGray
-   mediumGray
-   lightGray
-   gray125
-   gray0625
-   darkHorizontal
-   darkVertical
-   darkDown
-   darkUp
-   darkGrid
-   darkTrellis
-   lightHorizontal
-   lightVertical
-   lightDown
-   lightUp
-   lightGrid
-   lightTrellis

#### Gradient Fills⬆

Property

Required

Description

type

Y

Value: 'gradient'  
Specifies this fill uses gradients

gradient

Y

Specifies gradient type. One of \['angle', 'path'\]

degree

angle

For 'angle' gradient, specifies the direction of the gradient. 0 is from the left to the right. Values from 1 - 359 rotates the direction clockwise

center

path

For 'path' gradient. Specifies the relative coordinates for the start of the path. 'left' and 'top' values range from 0 to 1

stops

Y

Specifies the gradient colour sequence. Is an array of objects containing position and color starting with position 0 and ending with position 1. Intermediary positions may be used to specify other colours on the path.

**Caveats**

Using the interface above it may be possible to create gradient fill effects not possible using the XLSX editor program. For example, Excel only supports angle gradients of 0, 45, 90 and 135. Similarly the sequence of stops may also be limited by the UI with positions \[0,1\] or \[0,0.5,1\] as the only options. Take care with this fill to be sure it is supported by the target XLSX viewers.

### Rich Text⬆

Individual cells now support rich text or in-cell formatting. Rich text values can control the font properties of any number of sub-strings within the text value. See Fonts for a complete list of details on what font properties are supported.

ws.getCell('A1').value \= {
  'richText': \[
    {'font': {'size': 12,'color': {'theme': 0},'name': 'Calibri','family': 2,'scheme': 'minor'},'text': 'This is '},
    {'font': {'italic': true,'size': 12,'color': {'theme': 0},'name': 'Calibri','scheme': 'minor'},'text': 'a'},
    {'font': {'size': 12,'color': {'theme': 1},'name': 'Calibri','family': 2,'scheme': 'minor'},'text': ' '},
    {'font': {'size': 12,'color': {'argb': 'FFFF6600'},'name': 'Calibri','scheme': 'minor'},'text': 'colorful'},
    {'font': {'size': 12,'color': {'theme': 1},'name': 'Calibri','family': 2,'scheme': 'minor'},'text': ' text '},
    {'font': {'size': 12,'color': {'argb': 'FFCCFFCC'},'name': 'Calibri','scheme': 'minor'},'text': 'with'},
    {'font': {'size': 12,'color': {'theme': 1},'name': 'Calibri','family': 2,'scheme': 'minor'},'text': ' in-cell '},
    {'font': {'bold': true,'size': 12,'color': {'theme': 1},'name': 'Calibri','family': 2,'scheme': 'minor'},'text': 'format'}
  \]
};

expect(ws.getCell('A1').text).to.equal('This is a colorful text with in-cell format');
expect(ws.getCell('A1').type).to.equal(Excel.ValueType.RichText);

### Cell Protection⬆

Cell level protection can be modified using the protection property.

ws.getCell('A1').protection \= {
  locked: false,
  hidden: true,
};

**Supported Protection Properties**

Property

Default

Description

locked

true

Specifies whether a cell will be locked if the sheet is protected.

hidden

false

Specifies whether a cell's formula will be visible if the sheet is protected.

Conditional Formatting⬆
-----------------------

Conditional formatting allows a sheet to show specific styles, icons, etc depending on cell values or any arbitrary formula.

Conditional formatting rules are added at the sheet level and will typically cover a range of cells.

Multiple rules can be applied to a given cell range and each rule will apply its own style.

If multiple rules affect a given cell, the rule priority value will determine which rule wins out if competing styles collide. The rule with the lower priority value wins. If priority values are not specified for a given rule, ExcelJS will assign them in ascending order.

Note: at present, only a subset of conditional formatting rules are supported. Specifically, only the formatting rules that do not require XML rendering inside an <extLst> element. This means that datasets and three specific icon sets (3Triangles, 3Stars, 5Boxes) are not supported.

// add a checkerboard pattern to A1:E7 based on row + col being even or odd
worksheet.addConditionalFormatting({
  ref: 'A1:E7',
  rules: \[
    {
      type: 'expression',
      formulae: \['MOD(ROW()+COLUMN(),2)=0'\],
      style: {fill: {type: 'pattern', pattern: 'solid', bgColor: {argb: 'FF00FF00'}}},
    }
  \]
})

Outline Levels⬆
---------------

Excel supports outlining; where rows or columns can be expanded or collapsed depending on what level of detail the user wishes to view.

Outline levels can be defined in column setup:

worksheet.columns \= \[
  { header: 'Id', key: 'id', width: 10 },
  { header: 'Name', key: 'name', width: 32 },
  { header: 'D.O.B.', key: 'DOB', width: 10, outlineLevel: 1 }
\];

Or directly on the row or column

worksheet.getColumn(3).outlineLevel \= 1;
worksheet.getRow(3).outlineLevel \= 1;

The sheet outline levels can be set on the worksheet

// set column outline level
worksheet.properties.outlineLevelCol \= 1;

// set row outline level
worksheet.properties.outlineLevelRow \= 1;

Note: adjusting outline levels on rows or columns or the outline levels on the worksheet will incur a side effect of also modifying the collapsed property of all rows or columns affected by the property change. E.g.:

worksheet.properties.outlineLevelCol \= 1;

worksheet.getColumn(3).outlineLevel \= 1;
expect(worksheet.getColumn(3).collapsed).to.be.true;

worksheet.properties.outlineLevelCol \= 2;
expect(worksheet.getColumn(3).collapsed).to.be.false;

The outline properties can be set on the worksheet

worksheet.properties.outlineProperties \= {
  summaryBelow: false,
  summaryRight: false,
};

Images⬆
-------

Adding images to a worksheet is a two-step process. First, the image is added to the workbook via the addImage() function which will also return an imageId value. Then, using the imageId, the image can be added to the worksheet either as a tiled background or covering a cell range.

Note: As of this version, adjusting or transforming the image is not supported and images are not supported in streaming mode.

### Add Image to Workbook⬆

The Workbook.addImage function supports adding images by filename or by Buffer. Note that in both cases, the extension must be specified. Valid extension values include 'jpeg', 'png', 'gif'.

// add image to workbook by filename
const imageId1 \= workbook.addImage({
  filename: 'path/to/image.jpg',
  extension: 'jpeg',
});

// add image to workbook by buffer
const imageId2 \= workbook.addImage({
  buffer: fs.readFileSync('path/to.image.png'),
  extension: 'png',
});

// add image to workbook by base64
const myBase64Image \= "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KG...";
const imageId2 \= workbook.addImage({
  base64: myBase64Image,
  extension: 'png',
});

### Add image background to worksheet⬆

Using the image id from Workbook.addImage, the background to a worksheet can be set using the addBackgroundImage function

// set background
worksheet.addBackgroundImage(imageId1);

### Add image over a range⬆

Using the image id from Workbook.addImage, an image can be embedded within the worksheet to cover a range. The coordinates calculated from the range will cover from the top-left of the first cell to the bottom right of the second.

// insert an image over B2:D6
worksheet.addImage(imageId2, 'B2:D6');

Using a structure instead of a range string, it is possible to partially cover cells.

Note that the coordinate system used for this is zero based, so the top-left of A1 will be { col: 0, row: 0 }. Fractions of cells can be specified by using floating point numbers, e.g. the midpoint of A1 is { col: 0.5, row: 0.5 }.

// insert an image over part of B2:D6
worksheet.addImage(imageId2, {
  tl: { col: 1.5, row: 1.5 },
  br: { col: 3.5, row: 5.5 }
});

The cell range can also have the property 'editAs' which will control how the image is anchored to the cell(s) It can have one of the following values:

Value

Description

undefined

It specifies the image will be moved and sized with cells

oneCell

This is the default. Image will be moved with cells but not sized

absolute

Image will not be moved or sized with cells

ws.addImage(imageId, {
  tl: { col: 0.1125, row: 0.4 },
  br: { col: 2.101046875, row: 3.4 },
  editAs: 'oneCell'
});

### Add image to a cell⬆

You can add an image to a cell and then define its width and height in pixels at 96dpi.

worksheet.addImage(imageId2, {
  tl: { col: 0, row: 0 },
  ext: { width: 500, height: 200 }
});

### Add image with hyperlinks⬆

You can add an image with hyperlinks to a cell, and defines the hyperlinks in image range.

worksheet.addImage(imageId2, {
  tl: { col: 0, row: 0 },
  ext: { width: 500, height: 200 },
  hyperlinks: {
    hyperlink: 'http://www.somewhere.com',
    tooltip: 'http://www.somewhere.com'
  }
});

Sheet Protection⬆
-----------------

Worksheets can be protected from modification by adding a password.

await worksheet.protect('the-password', options);

Worksheet protection can also be removed:

worksheet.unprotect();

See Cell Protection for details on how to modify individual cell protection.

**Note:** While the protect() function returns a Promise indicating that it is async, the current implementation runs on the main thread and will use approx 600ms on an average CPU. This can be adjusted by setting the spinCount, which can be used to make the process either faster or more resilient.

Dates are formatted using the npm module dayjs. If no dateFormat is supplied, dayjs.ISO\_8601 is used. When writing a CSV you can supply the boolean dateUTC as true to have ExcelJS parse the date without automatically converting the timezone using `dayjs.utc()`.

### Streaming I/O⬆

The File I/O documented above requires that an entire workbook is built up in memory before the file can be written. While convenient, it can limit the size of the document due to the amount of memory required.

A streaming writer (or reader) processes the workbook or worksheet data as it is generated, converting it into file form as it goes. Typically this is much more efficient on memory as the final memory footprint and even intermediate memory footprints are much more compact than with the document version, especially when you consider that the row and cell objects are disposed once they are committed.

The interface to the streaming workbook and worksheet is almost the same as the document versions with a few minor practical differences:

-   Once a worksheet is added to a workbook, it cannot be removed.
-   Once a row is committed, it is no longer accessible since it will have been dropped from the worksheet.
-   unMergeCells() is not supported.

Note that it is possible to build the entire workbook without committing any rows. When the workbook is committed, all added worksheets (including all uncommitted rows) will be automatically committed. However in this case, little will have been gained over the Document version.

#### Streaming XLSX⬆

##### Streaming XLSX Writer(#contents)

The streaming XLSX workbook writer is available in the ExcelJS.stream.xlsx namespace.

The constructor takes an optional options object with the following fields:

Field

Description

stream

Specifies a writable stream to write the XLSX workbook to.

filename

If stream not specified, this field specifies the path to a file to write the XLSX workbook to.

useSharedStrings

Specifies whether to use shared strings in the workbook. Default is `false`.

useStyles

Specifies whether to add style information to the workbook. Styles can add some performance overhead. Default is `false`.

zip

Zip options that ExcelJS internally passes to Archiver. Default is `undefined`.

If neither stream nor filename is specified in the options, the workbook writer will create a StreamBuf object that will store the contents of the XLSX workbook in memory. This StreamBuf object, which can be accessed via the property workbook.stream, can be used to either access the bytes directly by stream.read() or to pipe the contents to another stream.

// construct a streaming XLSX workbook writer with styles and shared strings
const options \= {
  filename: './streamed-workbook.xlsx',
  useStyles: true,
  useSharedStrings: true
};
const workbook \= new Excel.stream.xlsx.WorkbookWriter(options);

In general, the interface to the streaming XLSX writer is the same as the Document workbook (and worksheets) described above, in fact the row, cell and style objects are the same.

However there are some differences...

**Construction**

As seen above, the WorkbookWriter will typically require the output stream or file to be specified in the constructor.

**Committing Data**

When a worksheet row is ready, it should be committed so that the row object and contents can be freed. Typically this would be done as each row is added...

worksheet.addRow({
   id: i,
   name: theName,
   etc: someOtherDetail
}).commit();

The reason the WorksheetWriter does not commit rows as they are added is to allow cells to be merged across rows:

worksheet.mergeCells('A1:B2');
worksheet.getCell('A1').value \= 'I am merged';
worksheet.getCell('C1').value \= 'I am not';
worksheet.getCell('C2').value \= 'Neither am I';
worksheet.getRow(2).commit(); // now rows 1 and two are committed.

As each worksheet is completed, it must also be committed:

// Finished adding data. Commit the worksheet
worksheet.commit();

To complete the XLSX document, the workbook must be committed. If any worksheet in a workbook are uncommitted, they will be committed automatically as part of the workbook commit.

// Finished the workbook.
await workbook.commit();
// ... the stream has been written

##### Streaming XLSX Reader(#contents)

The streaming XLSX workbook reader is available in the ExcelJS.stream.xlsx namespace.

The constructor takes a required input argument and an optional options argument:

Argument

Description

input (required)

Specifies the name of the file or the readable stream from which to read the XLSX workbook.

options (optional)

Specifies how to handle the event types occuring during the read parsing.

options.entries

Specifies whether to emit entries (`'emit'`) or not (`'ignore'`). Default is `'emit'`.

options.sharedStrings

Specifies whether to cache shared strings (`'cache'`), which inserts them into the respective cell values, or whether to emit them (`'emit'`) or ignore them (`'ignore'`), in both of which case the cell value will be a reference to the shared string's index. Default is `'cache'`.

options.hyperlinks

Specifies whether to cache hyperlinks (`'cache'`), which inserts them into their respective cells, whether to emit them (`'emit'`) or whether to ignore them (`'ignore'`). Default is `'cache'`.

options.styles

Specifies whether to cache styles (`'cache'`), which inserts them into their respective rows and cells, or whether to ignore them (`'ignore'`). Default is `'cache'`.

options.worksheets

Specifies whether to emit worksheets (`'emit'`) or not (`'ignore'`). Default is `'emit'`.

const workbookReader \= new ExcelJS.stream.xlsx.WorkbookReader('./file.xlsx');
for await (const worksheetReader of workbookReader) {
  for await (const row of worksheetReader) {
    // ...
  }
}

Please note that `worksheetReader` returns an array of rows rather than each row individually for performance reasons: nodejs/node#31979

###### Iterating over all events(#contents)

Events on workbook are 'worksheet', 'shared-strings' and 'hyperlinks'. Events on worksheet are 'row' and 'hyperlinks'.

const options \= {
  sharedStrings: 'emit',
  hyperlinks: 'emit',
  worksheets: 'emit',
};
const workbook \= new ExcelJS.stream.xlsx.WorkbookReader('./file.xlsx', options);
for await (const {eventType, value} of workbook.parse()) {
  switch (eventType) {
    case 'shared-strings':
      // value is the shared string
    case 'worksheet':
      // value is the worksheetReader
    case 'hyperlinks':
      // value is the hyperlinksReader
  }
}

###### Readable stream(#contents)

While we strongly encourage to use async iteration, we also expose a streaming interface for backwards compatibility.

const options \= {
  sharedStrings: 'emit',
  hyperlinks: 'emit',
  worksheets: 'emit',
};
const workbookReader \= new ExcelJS.stream.xlsx.WorkbookReader('./file.xlsx', options);
workbookReader.read();

workbookReader.on('worksheet', worksheet \=> {
  worksheet.on('row', row \=> {
  });
});

workbookReader.on('shared-strings', sharedString \=> {
  // ...
});

workbookReader.on('hyperlinks', hyperlinksReader \=> {
  // ...
});

workbookReader.on('end', () \=> {
  // ...
});
workbookReader.on('error', (err) \=> {
  // ...
});

Browser⬆
========

A portion of this library has been isolated and tested for use within a browser environment.

Due to the streaming nature of the workbook reader and workbook writer, these have not been included. Only the document based workbook may be used (see Create a Workbook for details).

For example code using ExcelJS in the browser take a look at the spec/browser folder in the github repo.

Prebundled⬆
-----------

The following files are pre-bundled and included inside the dist folder.

-   exceljs.js
-   exceljs.min.js

Value Types⬆
============

The following value types are supported.

Null Value⬆
-----------

Enum: Excel.ValueType.Null

A null value indicates an absence of value and will typically not be stored when written to file (except for merged cells). It can be used to remove the value from a cell.

E.g.

worksheet.getCell('A1').value \= null;

Merge Cell⬆
-----------

Enum: Excel.ValueType.Merge

A merge cell is one that has its value bound to another 'master' cell. Assigning to a merge cell will cause the master's cell to be modified.

Number Value⬆
-------------

Enum: Excel.ValueType.Number

A numeric value.

E.g.

worksheet.getCell('A1').value \= 5;
worksheet.getCell('A2').value \= 3.14159;

String Value⬆
-------------

Enum: Excel.ValueType.String

A simple text string.

E.g.

worksheet.getCell('A1').value \= 'Hello, World!';

Date Value⬆
-----------

Enum: Excel.ValueType.Date

A date value, represented by the JavaScript Date type.

E.g.

worksheet.getCell('A1').value \= new Date(2017, 2, 15);

Hyperlink Value⬆
----------------

Enum: Excel.ValueType.Hyperlink

A URL with both text and link value.

E.g.

// link to web
worksheet.getCell('A1').value \= {
  text: 'www.mylink.com',
  hyperlink: 'http://www.mylink.com',
  tooltip: 'www.mylink.com'
};

// internal link
worksheet.getCell('A1').value \= { text: 'Sheet2', hyperlink: '#\\'Sheet2\\'!A1' };

Formula Value⬆
--------------

Enum: Excel.ValueType.Formula

An Excel formula for calculating values on the fly. Note that while the cell type will be Formula, the cell may have an effectiveType value that will be derived from the result value.

Note that ExcelJS cannot process the formula to generate a result, it must be supplied.

Note that function semantic names must be in English and the separator must be a comma.

E.g.

worksheet.getCell('A3').value \= { formula: 'A1+A2', result: 7 };
worksheet.getCell('A3').value \= { formula: 'SUM(A1,A2)', result: 7 };

Cells also support convenience getters to access the formula and result:

worksheet.getCell('A3').formula \=== 'A1+A2';
worksheet.getCell('A3').result \=== 7;

### Shared Formula⬆

Shared formulae enhance the compression of the xlsx document by decreasing the repetition of text within the worksheet xml. The top-left cell in a range is the designated master and will hold the formula that all the other cells in the range will derive from. The other 'slave' cells can then refer to this master cell instead of redefining the whole formula again. Note that the master formula will be translated to the slave cells in the usual Excel fashion so that references to other cells will be shifted down and to the right depending on the slave's offset to the master. For example: if the master cell A2 has a formula referencing A1 then if cell B2 shares A2's formula, then it will reference B1.

A master formula can be assigned to a cell along with the slave cells in its range

worksheet.getCell('A2').value \= {
  formula: 'A1',
  result: 10,
  shareType: 'shared',
  ref: 'A2:B3'
};

A shared formula can be assigned to a cell using a new value form:

worksheet.getCell('B2').value \= { sharedFormula: 'A2', result: 10 };

This specifies that the cell B2 is a formula that will be derived from the formula in A2 and its result is 10.

The formula convenience getter will translate the formula in A2 to what it should be in B2:

expect(worksheet.getCell('B2').formula).to.equal('B1');

Shared formulae can be assigned into a sheet using the 'fillFormula' function:

// set A1 to starting number
worksheet.getCell('A1').value \= 1;

// fill A2 to A10 with ascending count starting from A1
worksheet.fillFormula('A2:A10', 'A1+1', \[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\]);

fillFormula can also use a callback function to calculate the value at each cell

// fill A2 to A100 with ascending count starting from A1
worksheet.fillFormula('A2:A100', 'A1+1', (row, col) \=> row);

### Formula Type⬆

To distinguish between real and translated formula cells, use the formulaType getter:

worksheet.getCell('A3').formulaType \=== Enums.FormulaType.Master;
worksheet.getCell('B3').formulaType \=== Enums.FormulaType.Shared;

Formula type has the following values:

Name

Value

Enums.FormulaType.None

0

Enums.FormulaType.Master

1

Enums.FormulaType.Shared

2

### Array Formula⬆

A new way of expressing shared formulae in Excel is the array formula. In this form, the master cell is the only cell that contains any information relating to a formula. It contains the shareType 'array' along with the range of cells it applies to and the formula that will be copied. The rest of the cells are regular cells with regular values.

Note: array formulae are not translated in the way shared formulae are. So if master cell A2 refers to A1, then slave cell B2 will also refer to A1.

E.g.

// assign array formula to A2:B3
worksheet.getCell('A2').value \= {
  formula: 'A1',
  result: 10,
  shareType: 'array',
  ref: 'A2:B3'
};

// it may not be necessary to fill the rest of the values in the sheet

The fillFormula function can also be used to fill an array formula

// fill A2:B3 with array formula "A1"
worksheet.fillFormula('A2:B3', 'A1', \[1,1,1,1\], 'array');

Rich Text Value⬆
----------------

Enum: Excel.ValueType.RichText

Rich, styled text.

E.g.

worksheet.getCell('A1').value \= {
  richText: \[
    { text: 'This is '},
    {font: {italic: true}, text: 'italic'},
  \]
};

Boolean Value⬆
--------------

Enum: Excel.ValueType.Boolean

E.g.

worksheet.getCell('A1').value \= true;
worksheet.getCell('A2').value \= false;

Error Value⬆
------------

Enum: Excel.ValueType.Error

E.g.

worksheet.getCell('A1').value \= { error: '#N/A' };
worksheet.getCell('A2').value \= { error: '#VALUE!' };

The current valid Error text values are:

Name

Value

Excel.ErrorValue.NotApplicable

#N/A

Excel.ErrorValue.Ref

#REF!

Excel.ErrorValue.Name

#NAME?

Excel.ErrorValue.DivZero

#DIV/0!

Excel.ErrorValue.Null

#NULL!

Excel.ErrorValue.Value

#VALUE!

Excel.ErrorValue.Num

#NUM!

Interface Changes⬆
==================

Every effort is made to make a good consistent interface that doesn't break through the versions but regrettably, now and then some things have to change for the greater good.

0.1.0⬆
------

### Worksheet.eachRow⬆

The arguments in the callback function to Worksheet.eachRow have been swapped and changed; it was function(rowNumber,rowValues), now it is function(row, rowNumber) which gives it a look and feel more like the underscore (\_.each) function and priorities the row object over the row number.

### Worksheet.getRow⬆

This function has changed from returning a sparse array of cell values to returning a Row object. This enables accessing row properties and will facilitate managing row styles and so on.

The sparse array of cell values is still available via Worksheet.getRow(rowNumber).values;

0.1.1⬆
------

### cell.model⬆

cell.styles renamed to cell.style

0.2.44⬆
-------

Promises returned from functions switched from Bluebird to native node Promise which can break calling code if they rely on Bluebird's extra features.

To mitigate this the following two changes were added to 0.3.0:

-   A more fully featured and still browser compatible promise lib is used by default. This lib supports many of the features of Bluebird but with a much lower footprint.
-   An option to inject a different Promise implementation. See Config section for more details.

Config⬆
=======

ExcelJS now supports dependency injection for the promise library. You can restore Bluebird promises by including the following code in your module...

ExcelJS.config.setValue('promise', require('bluebird'));

Please note: I have tested ExcelJS with bluebird specifically (since up until recently this was the library it used). From the tests I have done it will not work with Q.

Caveats⬆
========

Dist Folder⬆
------------

Before publishing this module, the source code is transpiled and otherwise processed before being placed in a dist/ folder. This README identifies two files - a browserified bundle and minified version. No other contents of the dist/ folder are guaranteed in any way other than the file specified as "main" in the package.json

Known Issues⬆
=============

Testing with Puppeteer⬆
-----------------------

The test suite included in this lib includes a small script executed in a headless browser to validate the bundled packages. At the time of this writing, it appears that this test does not play nicely in the Windows Linux subsystem.

For this reason, the browser test can be disabled by the existence of a file named .disable-test-browser

sudo apt-get install libfontconfig

Splice vs Merge⬆
----------------

If any splice operation affects a merged cell, the merge group will not be moved correctly

-   Streaming XLSX Writer
    -   At long last ExcelJS can support writing massive XLSX files in a scalable memory efficient manner. Performance has been optimised and even smaller spreadsheets can be faster to write than the document writer. Options have been added to control the use of shared strings and styles as these can both have a considerable effect on performance
-   Worksheet.lastRow
    -   Access the last editable row in a worksheet.
-   Row.commit()
    -   For streaming writers, this method commits the row (and any previous rows) to the stream. Committed rows will no longer be editable (and are typically deleted from the worksheet object). For Document type workbooks, this method has no effect.

    -   Error Value
    
    Note: Minor version has been bumped up to 4 as this release introduces a couple of interface changes:
    -   Boolean cells previously will have returned 1 or 0 will now return true or false
    -   Error cells that previously returned a string value will now return an error structure
-   Fixed issue Code correctness - setters don't return a value #280.

0.4.1

-   Merged Add support for cp:contentStatus #285. Thanks to holm for the contribution.
-   Merged Fix Valid characters in XML (allow \\n and \\r when saving) #286. Thanks to Rycochet for the contribution.
-   Fixed hyperlink with query arguments corrupts workbook #275. The hyperlink target is not escaped before serialising in the xml.

0.4.2

-   Addressed the following issues:
    
    -   White text and borders being changed to black #290
    -   Losing formatting/pivot table from loaded file #261
    -   Solid fill become black #272
    
    These issues are potentially caused by a bug that caused colours with zero themes, tints or indexes to be rendered and parsed incorrectly.
    
    Regarding themes: the theme files stored inside the xlsx container hold important information regarding colours, styles etc and if the theme information from a loaded xlsx file is lost, the results can be unpredictable and undesirable. To address this, when an ExcelJS Workbook parses an XLSX file, it will preserve any theme files it finds and include them when writing to a new XLSX. If this behaviour is not desired, the Workbook class exposes a clearThemes() function which will drop the theme content. Note that this behaviour is only implemented in the document based Workbook class, not the streamed Reader and Writer.

2.0.1

Major Version Change
--------------------

Introducing async/await to ExcelJS!

The new async and await features of JavaScript can help a lot to make code more readable and maintainable. To avoid confusion, particularly with returned promises from async functions, we have had to remove the Promise class configuration option and from v2 onwards ExcelJS will use native Promises. Since this is potentially a breaking change we're bumping the major version for this release.

Changes
-------

-   Merged Introduce async/await #829. Many thanks to Andreas Lubbe for this contribution.
-   Merged Update index.d.ts #930. Many thanks to cosmonovallc for this contributions.
-   Merged TS: Add types for addTable function #940. Many thanks to egmen for this contributions.
-   Merged added explicit return types to the type definitions of Worksheet.protect() and Worksheet.unprotect() #926. Many thanks to Tamas Czinege for this contributions.
-   Dropped dependencies on Promise libraries.

3.0.0

Another Major Version Change
----------------------------

Javascript has changed a lot over the years, and so have the modules and technologies surrounding it. To this end, this major version of ExcelJS changes the structure of the publish artefacts:

### Main Export is now the Original Javascript Source

Prior to this release, the transpiled ES5 code was exported as the package main. From now on, the package main comes directly from the lib/ folder. This means a number of dependencies have been removed, including the polyfills.

### ES5 and Browserify are Still Included

In order to support those that still require ES5 ready code (e.g. as dependencies in web apps) the source code will still be transpiled and available in dist/es5.

The ES5 code is also browserified and available as dist/exceljs.js or dist/exceljs.min.js
