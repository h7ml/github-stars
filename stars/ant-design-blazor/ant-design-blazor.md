Regularly synchronize with Official Ant Design specifications, you can check the sync logs online.

**Before the 1.0 release, we will only sync antd 4.x styles.**

üì¶ Installation Guide
---------------------

### Prerequirement

-   Install .NET Core SDK 3.1.300 or later, .NET 8 is even better.

### Option 1: Create a new project from the dotnet new template

We have provided the `dotnet new` template to create a Boilerplate project out of the boxÔºö

-   Install the template
    
    $ dotnet new --install AntDesign.Templates
    
-   Create the Boilerplate project with the template
    
    $ dotnet new antdesign -o MyAntDesignApp
    

Options for the templateÔºö

Options

Description

Type

Default

`-f` | `--full`

If specified, generates all pages of Ant Design Pro

bool

false

`-ho` | `--host`

Specify the hosting model

'webapp' | 'wasm' | 'server'

'webapp'

`--styles`

Whether use NodeJS and Less to compile your custom themes.

`css` | `less`

`css`

`--no-restore`

If specified, skips the automatic restore of the project on create

bool

false

### Option 2: Import Ant Design Blazor into an existing project

-   Go to the project folder of the application and install the Nuget package reference
    
    $ dotnet add package AntDesign
    
-   Register the services in `Program.cs`
    
    builder.Services.AddAntDesign();
    
    or `Startup.cs`
    
    services.AddAntDesign();
    
-   Add namespace in `_Imports.razor`
    
    @using AntDesign
    
-   Introduce CSS and JS files in appropriate places. The WebApp project was introduced in App.razor, and the WebAssembly project was introduced in index.html
    
      <link href\="\_content/AntDesign/css/ant-design-blazor.css" rel\="stylesheet"\>
      <script src\="\_content/AntDesign/js/ant-design-blazor.js"\></script\>
    
-   To display the pop-up component dynamically, you need to add the `<AntContainer />` component in `App.razor`.
    
    -   For Blazor WebApp, you also need to specify render mode to `<Routes />` for interactivity.
    
    <Routes @rendermode="RenderMode.InteractiveAuto" />            <-- specify the rendermode ‚ú®
    + <AntContainer @rendermode="RenderMode.InteractiveAuto" />    <-- add this component ‚ú®
    
    -   For legacy blazor apps just add a line of code:
    
    <Router AppAssembly="@typeof(MainLayout).Assembly">
        <Found Context="routeData">
            <RouteView RouteData="routeData" DefaultLayout="@typeof(MainLayout)" />
        </Found>
        <NotFound>
            <LayoutView Layout="@typeof(MainLayout)">
                <Result Status="404" />
            </LayoutView>
        </NotFound>
    </Router>
    
    +  <AntContainer />   <-- add this component ‚ú®
    
-   Finally, it can be referenced in the `.razor` component!
    
    <Button Type\="@ButtonType.Primary"\>Hello World!</Button\>
