🤔 Why does AionUi exist?
-------------------------

While the official Gemini CLI is powerful, its command-line interface has limitations for daily use. AionUi provides a GUI alternative that addresses these key pain points:

> -   Using the `@` command to select files is cumbersome
> -   Conversations are lost when closing the CLI window
> -   Command-line interface lacks natural chat interactions
> -   Single conversation mode limits parallel workflows
> -   Restricted to Gemini models only, unable to use other excellent large language models

AionUi provides a modern interface for users who need better workflow efficiency, while **breaking the single-model limitation**, allowing you to choose the most suitable AI model for different task requirements.
