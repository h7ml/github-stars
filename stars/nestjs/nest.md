A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.

Description
-----------

Nest is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. It uses modern JavaScript, is built with TypeScript (preserves compatibility with pure JavaScript) and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).

Under the hood, Nest makes use of Express, but also provides compatibility with a wide range of other libraries, like Fastify, allowing for easy use of the myriad of third-party plugins which are available.

Philosophy
----------

In recent years, thanks to Node.js, JavaScript has become the “lingua franca” of the web for both front and backend applications, giving rise to awesome projects like Angular, React, and Vue, which improve developer productivity and enable the construction of fast, testable, and extensible frontend applications. However, on the server-side, while there are a lot of superb libraries, helpers, and tools for Node, none of them effectively solve the main problem - the architecture.

Nest aims to provide an application architecture out of the box which allows for effortless creation of highly testable, scalable, and loosely coupled and easily maintainable applications. The architecture is heavily inspired by Angular.
