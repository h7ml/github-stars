🏢 Enterprise Edition
=====================

Building on the Community Edition, we are proud to introduce **Cherry Studio Enterprise Edition**—a privately-deployable AI productivity and management platform designed for modern teams and enterprises.

The Enterprise Edition addresses core challenges in team collaboration by centralizing the management of AI resources, knowledge, and data. It empowers organizations to enhance efficiency, foster innovation, and ensure compliance, all while maintaining 100% control over their data in a secure environment.

Core Advantages
---------------

-   **Unified Model Management**: Centrally integrate and manage various cloud-based LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini) and locally deployed private models. Employees can use them out-of-the-box without individual configuration.
-   **Enterprise-Grade Knowledge Base**: Build, manage, and share team-wide knowledge bases. Ensures knowledge retention and consistency, enabling team members to interact with AI based on unified and accurate information.
-   **Fine-Grained Access Control**: Easily manage employee accounts and assign role-based permissions for different models, knowledge bases, and features through a unified admin backend.
-   **Fully Private Deployment**: Deploy the entire backend service on your on-premises servers or private cloud, ensuring your data remains 100% private and under your control to meet the strictest security and compliance standards.
-   **Reliable Backend Services**: Provides stable API services and enterprise-grade data backup and recovery mechanisms to ensure business continuity.

✨ Online Demo
-------------

> 🚧 **Public Beta Notice**

> The Enterprise Edition is currently in its early public beta stage, and we are actively iterating and optimizing its features. We are aware that it may not be perfectly stable yet.
