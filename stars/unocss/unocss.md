Features
--------

Inspired by Windi CSS, Tailwind CSS, and Twind, but:

-   Fully customizable - no core utilities. All functionalities are provided via presets.
-   No parsing, no AST, no scanning, it's **INSTANT** (5x faster than Windi CSS or Tailwind JIT).
-   ~6kb min+brotli - zero deps and browser friendly.
-   Shortcuts - aliasing utilities, dynamically.
-   Attributify mode - group utilities in attributes.
-   Pure CSS Icons - use any icon as a single class.
-   Variant Groups - shorthand for group utils with common prefixes.
-   CSS Directives - reuse utils in CSS with `@apply` directive.
-   Compilation mode - synthesizes multiple classes into one at build time.
-   Inspector - inspect and debug interactively.
-   CSS-in-JS Runtime build - use UnoCSS with one line of CDN import.
-   VS Code extension
-   Code-splitting for CSS - ships minimal CSS for MPA.
