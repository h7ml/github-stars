Logster
=======

> **Note**  
> This is the documentation for v2 of Logster. If you're looking for v1, see the v1 branch.

An easy-to-parse, single-line logger for Elixir Phoenix and Plug applications. Supports logfmt, JSON and custom formatting.

Motivation
----------

By default, the Phoenix log output for a request looks like:

```
[info] GET /articles/some-article
[debug] Processing with HelloPhoenix.ArticleController.show/2
  Parameters: %{"id" => "some-article"}
  Pipelines: [:browser]
[info] Sent 200 in 21ms
```

This can be handy for development, but cumbersome in production. The log output is spread across multiple lines making it difficult to parse and search.

Logster aims to solve this problem by logging the request in a easy-to-parse single line like:

```
[info] state=sent method=GET path=/articles/some-article format=html controller=HelloPhoenix.ArticleController action=show params={"id":"some-article"} status=200 duration=0.402
```

This is especially handy when integrating with log management services such as Better Stack or Papertrail.

Alternatively, Logster can also output JSON formatted logs (see configuration section below), or you can provide a custom formatter:

```
[info] {"state":"sent","method":"GET","path":"/articles/some-article","format":"html","controller":"HelloPhoenix.ArticleController","action":"show","params":{"id":"some-article"},"status":200,"duration":0.402}
```

Migrating from v1.x to v2.x

Installation
------------

Add `:logster` to the list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

def deps do
  \[{:logster, "~> 2.0.0-rc.1"}\]
end

Usage
-----

### Using with Phoenix

Attach the Logster Phoenix logger in the `start` function in your project's `application.ex` file:

\# lib/my\_app/application.ex
def start(\_type, \_args) do
  children \= \[
    \# ...
  \]

  #
  \# Add the line below:
  #
  :ok \= Logster.attach\_phoenix\_logger()

  opts \= \[strategy: :one\_for\_one, name: MyApp.Supervisor\]
  Supervisor.start\_link(children, opts)
end

Next, disable the default Phoenix logger by adding the following line to your `config.exs` file:

\# config/config.exs
config :phoenix, :logger, false

### Using with Plug

Add `Logster.Plug` to your plug pipeline, or in the relevant module:

plug Logster.Plug

### Using the standalone logger

Logster provides `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error` etc convenience functions that mimic those provided by the elixir logger, which outputs messages in your chosen log format.

For example:

Logster.info(service: :payments, event: :received, amount: 1000, customer: 123)

will output the following:

```
[info] service=payments event=received amount=1000 customer=123
```

You can also provide a function to be called lazily, which will only be called if the log level is enabled:

Logster.debug(fn \->
  \# some potentially expensive operation
  \# won't be called if the log level is not enabled
  customer \= get\_customer\_id()

  \[service: :payments, event: :received, amount: 1000, customer: customer\]
end)

Configuration
-------------

### Application wide

You can configure Logster application wide using your `config.exs`, or environment specific config file by providing options like:

config :logster,
  formatter: :json,
  headers: \["content-type"\],
  excludes: \[:params\]

### Per request

You can then customize each option on a request basis by passing them as options to the `Logster.ChangeConfig` plug in the relevant controller or plug:

plug Logster.ChangeConfig, status\_2xx\_level: :debug, headers: \["content-type", "x-request-id"\]

or, for specific actions in the controller:

plug Logster.ChangeConfig, \[status\_2xx\_level: :debug, headers: \["content-type", "x-request-id"\]\] when action in \[:index, :show\]

This is specially useful for cases such as when you want to lower the log level for a healthcheck endpoint that gets hit every few seconds.

### Plug level

If you're using the `Logster.Plug` plug, you can also pass options to it directly:

plug Logster.Plug, status\_2xx\_level: :debug, headers: \["content-type", "x-request-id"\]

Configuration options
---------------------

### Formatter

#### JSON formatter

config :logster, formatter: :json

_Caution:_ There is no guarantee that what reaches your console will be valid JSON. The Elixir `Logger` module has its own formatting which may be appended to your message. See the Logger documentation for more information.

#### Custom formatter

Provide a function that takes one argument, the parameters as input, and returns formatted output

config :logster, formatter: &MyCustomFormatter.format/1

### Log level per status group

You can change the log level for each status group by using the following configuration options:

config :logster,
  status\_2xx\_level: :debug, \# default: :info
  status\_3xx\_level: :debug, \# default: :info
  status\_4xx\_level: :info,  \# default: :warning
  status\_5xx\_level: :error  \# default: :error

### Fine grained log level configuration

You can specify a function to be called to determine the log level for each request.

This function will be called with the `conn`, and expects a logger level, or `false` to not log the request as return value.

\# config/config.exs
config :logster, log: {MyLoggingModule, :log\_level, \[\]}

defmodule MyLoggingModule do
  def log\_level(%{status: status}) when status \>= 500, do: :error
  def log\_level(%{status: status}) when status \>= 400, do: :warning
  def log\_level(%{path\_info: \["status" | \_\]}), do: false
  def log\_level(\_), do: :info
end

### Request headers

By default, Logster won't log any request headers. To log specific headers, you can use the `:headers` option:

config :logster, headers: \["my-header-one", "my-header-two"\]

### Enabling extra fields

One or more of the following fields can be optionally enabled through the `extra_fields` configuration option:

-   host
-   query

Example:

config :logster, extra\_fields: \[:host, :query\]

### Excluding fields

You can exclude fields with `:excludes`:

config :logster, excludes: \[:params, :status, :state\]

Example output:

```
[info] method=GET path=/articles/some-article format=html controller=HelloPhoenix.ArticleController action=show duration=0.402
```

### Renaming default fields

You can rename the default keys passing a keyword list like:

config :logster, renames: \[duration: :response\_time, params: :parameters\]

Example output:

```
[info] method=GET path=/articles/some-article format=html controller=HelloPhoenix.ArticleController action=show parameters={"id":"some-article"} status=200 response_time=0.402 state=set
```

### Filtering parameters

By default, Logster filters parameters named `password`.

To change the filtered parameters:

config :logster, filter\_parameters: \["password", "secret", "token"\]

### Metadata

Custom metadata can be added to logs using `Logger.metadata` and configuring your logger backend:

\# add metadata for all future logs from this process
Logger.metadata(%{user\_id: "123", foo: "bar"})

\# example for configuring console backend to include metadata in logs.
\# see https://hexdocs.pm/logger/Logger.html#module-console-backend documentation for more
\# config.exs
config :logger, :console, metadata: \[:user\_id, :foo\]

The easiest way to do this app wide is to introduce a new plug which you can include in your Phoenix router pipeline.

For example:

defmodule HelloPhoenix.SetLoggerMetadata do
  def init(opts), do: opts

  def call(conn, \_opts) do
    Logger.metadata user\_id: get\_user\_id(conn),
                    remote\_ip: format\_ip(conn)
    conn
  end

  defp format\_ip(%{remote\_ip: remote\_ip}) when remote\_ip != nil, do: :inet\_parse.ntoa(remote\_ip)
  defp format\_ip(\_), do: nil

  defp get\_user\_id(%{assigns: %{current\_user: %{id: id}}}), do: id
  defp get\_user\_id(\_), do: nil
end

And then add this plug to the relevant pipelines in the router:

pipeline :browser do
  plug :fetch\_session
  plug :fetch\_flash
  plug :put\_secure\_browser\_headers
  \# ...
  plug HelloPhoenix.SetLoggerMetadata
  \# ...
end
