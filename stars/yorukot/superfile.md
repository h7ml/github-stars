We have an auto update functionality, that fetches superfile's latest released version from github (if last timestamp of last version check was less than 24 hours) and prints a prompt to user, if there is a newer version available.

You can turn this off, by setting `auto_check_update` to false in superfile config. **Click me to see the config wiki**
