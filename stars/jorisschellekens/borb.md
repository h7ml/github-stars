borb
====

`borb` is a library for creating and manipulating PDF files in python.

0\. About borb
--------------

`borb` is a pure python library to read, write and manipulate PDF documents. It represents a PDF document as a JSON-like datastructure of nested lists, dictionaries and primitives (numbers, string, booleans, etc)

This is currently a one-man project, so the focus will always be to support those use-cases that are more common in favor of those that are rare.

ðŸ“£ **Next (major) release**: You can track the status of the next release on a dedicated GitHub Pages.

1\. About the Examples
----------------------

The examples can be found in a separate repository. This ensures the `borb` repository stays relatively small, whilst still providing a thorough knowledgebase of code-samples, screenshots and explanatory text.

Check out the examples repository here!

They include;

-   Reading a PDF and extracting meta-information
-   Changing meta-information
-   Extracting text from a PDF
-   Extracting images from a PDF
-   Changing images in a PDF
-   Adding annotations (notes, links, etc) to a PDF
-   Adding text to a PDF
-   Adding tables to a PDF
-   Adding lists to a PDF
-   Using a PageLayout manager

and much more

### 1.0 Installing `borb`

`borb` can be installed using `pip`

```
pip install borb
```

If you have installed `borb` before, and you want to ensure `pip` downloads the latest version (rather than using its internal cache) you can use the following commands:

```
pip uninstall borb
pip install --no-cache borb
```

### 1.1 Hello World

To give you an immediate idea of the way `borb` works, this is the classic `Hello World` example, in `borb`:

from pathlib import Path

from borb.pdf import Document
from borb.pdf import Page
from borb.pdf import SingleColumnLayout
from borb.pdf import Paragraph
from borb.pdf import PDF

\# create an empty Document
pdf \= Document()

\# add an empty Page
page \= Page()
pdf.add\_page(page)

\# use a PageLayout (SingleColumnLayout in this case)
layout \= SingleColumnLayout(page)

\# add a Paragraph object
layout.add(Paragraph("Hello World!"))
    
\# store the PDF
with open(Path("output.pdf"), "wb") as pdf\_file\_handle:
    PDF.dumps(pdf\_file\_handle, pdf)

2\. License
-----------

`borb` is dual licensed as AGPL/Commercial software.

AGPL is a free / open source software license. This doesn't mean the software is gratis!

Buying a license is mandatory as soon as you develop commercial activities distributing the borb software inside your product or deploying it on a network without disclosing the source code of your own applications under the AGPL license. These activities include:

-   Offering paid services to customers as an ASP
-   Serving PDFs on the fly in the cloud or in a web application
-   Shipping `borb` with a closed source product
