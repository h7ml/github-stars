dive
====

**A tool for exploring a Docker image, layer contents, and discovering ways to shrink the size of your Docker/OCI image.**

To analyze a Docker image simply run dive with an image tag/id/digest:

dive <your-image-tag\>

or you can dive with Docker directly:

```
alias dive="docker run -ti --rm  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock docker.io/wagoodman/dive"
dive <your-image-tag>

# for example
dive nginx:latest
```

or if you want to build your image then jump straight into analyzing it:

dive build -t <some-tag\> .

Building on macOS (supporting only the Docker container engine):

docker run --rm -it \\
      -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\
      -v  "$(pwd)":"$(pwd)" \\
      -w "$(pwd)" \\
      -v "$HOME/.dive.yaml":"$HOME/.dive.yaml" \\
      docker.io/wagoodman/dive:latest build -t <some-tag\> .

Additionally you can run this in your CI pipeline to ensure you're keeping wasted space to a minimum (this skips the UI):

```
CI=true dive <your-image>
```

**This is beta quality!** _Feel free to submit an issue if you want a new feature or find a bug :)_

Basic Features
--------------

**Show Docker image contents broken down by layer**

As you select a layer on the left, you are shown the contents of that layer combined with all previous layers on the right. Also, you can fully explore the file tree with the arrow keys.

**Indicate what's changed in each layer**

Files that have changed, been modified, added, or removed are indicated in the file tree. This can be adjusted to show changes for a specific layer, or aggregated changes up to this layer.

**Estimate "image efficiency"**

The lower left pane shows basic layer info and an experimental metric that will guess how much wasted space your image contains. This might be from duplicating files across layers, moving files across layers, or not fully removing files. Both a percentage "score" and total wasted file space is provided.

**Quick build/analysis cycles**

You can build a Docker image and do an immediate analysis with one command: `dive build -t some-tag .`

You only need to replace your `docker build` command with the same `dive build` command.

**CI Integration**

Analyze an image and get a pass/fail result based on the image efficiency and wasted space. Simply set `CI=true` in the environment when invoking any valid dive command.

**Multiple Image Sources and Container Engines Supported**

With the `--source` option, you can select where to fetch the container image from:

dive <your-image\> --source <source\>

or

dive <source\>://<your-image\>

With valid `source` options as such:

-   `docker`: Docker engine (the default option)
-   `docker-archive`: A Docker Tar Archive from disk
-   `podman`: Podman engine (linux only)

Installation
------------

**Ubuntu/Debian**

Using debs:

DIVE\_VERSION=$(curl -sL "https://api.github.com/repos/wagoodman/dive/releases/latest" | grep '"tag\_name":' | sed -E 's/.\*"v(\[^"\]+)".\*/\\1/')
curl -fOL "https://github.com/wagoodman/dive/releases/download/v${DIVE\_VERSION}/dive\_${DIVE\_VERSION}\_linux\_amd64.deb"
sudo apt install ./dive\_${DIVE\_VERSION}\_linux\_amd64.deb

Using snap:

sudo snap install docker
sudo snap install dive
sudo snap connect dive:docker-executables docker:docker-executables
sudo snap connect dive:docker-daemon docker:docker-daemon

Caution

The Snap method is not recommended if you installed Docker via `apt-get`, since it might break your existing Docker daemon.

See also: #546

**RHEL/Centos**

DIVE\_VERSION=$(curl -sL "https://api.github.com/repos/wagoodman/dive/releases/latest" | grep '"tag\_name":' | sed -E 's/.\*"v(\[^"\]+)".\*/\\1/')
curl -fOL "https://github.com/wagoodman/dive/releases/download/v${DIVE\_VERSION}/dive\_${DIVE\_VERSION}\_linux\_amd64.rpm"
rpm -i dive\_${DIVE\_VERSION}\_linux\_amd64.rpm

**Arch Linux**

Available in the extra repository and can be installed via pacman:

pacman -S dive

**Mac**

If you use Homebrew:

brew install dive

If you use MacPorts:

sudo port install dive

Or download the latest Darwin build from the releases page.

**Windows**

If you use Chocolatey

choco install dive

If you use scoop

scoop install main/dive

If you use winget:

winget install \--id wagoodman.dive

Or download the latest Windows build from the releases page.

**Go tools** Requires Go version 1.10 or higher.

go install github.com/wagoodman/dive@latest

_Note_: installing in this way you will not see a proper version when running `dive -v`.

**Nix/NixOS**

On NixOS:

nix-env -iA nixos.dive

On non-NixOS (Linux, Mac)

nix-env -iA nixpkgs.dive

**X-CMD**

x-cmd is a **toolbox for Posix Shell**, offering a lightweight package manager built using shell and awk.

x env use dive

**Docker**

docker pull docker.io/wagoodman/dive
# or alternatively
docker pull ghcr.io/wagoodman/dive

When running you'll need to include the Docker socket file:

docker run --rm -it \\
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\
    docker.io/wagoodman/dive:latest <dive arguments...\>

Docker for Windows (showing PowerShell compatible line breaks; collapse to a single line for Command Prompt compatibility)

docker run --rm -it \`
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \`
    docker.io/wagoodman/dive:latest <dive arguments...\>

**Note:** depending on the version of docker you are running locally you may need to specify the docker API version as an environment variable:

   DOCKER\_API\_VERSION=1.37 dive ...

or if you are running with a docker image:

docker run --rm -it \\
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\
    -e DOCKER\_API\_VERSION=1.37 \\
    docker.io/wagoodman/dive:latest <dive arguments...\>

if you are using an alternative runtime (Colima etc) then you may need to specify the docker host as an environment variable in order to pull local images:

   export DOCKER\_HOST=$(docker context inspect -f '{{ .Endpoints.docker.Host }}')

CI Integration
--------------

When running dive with the environment variable `CI=true` then the dive UI will be bypassed and will instead analyze your docker image, giving it a pass/fail indication via return code. Currently there are three metrics supported via a `.dive-ci` file that you can put at the root of your repo:

```
rules:
  # If the efficiency is measured below X%, mark as failed.
  # Expressed as a ratio between 0-1.
  lowestEfficiency: 0.95

  # If the amount of wasted space is at least X or larger than X, mark as failed.
  # Expressed in B, KB, MB, and GB.
  highestWastedBytes: 20MB

  # If the amount of wasted space makes up for X% or more of the image, mark as failed.
  # Note: the base image layer is NOT included in the total image size.
  # Expressed as a ratio between 0-1; fails if the threshold is met or crossed.
  highestUserWastedPercent: 0.20
```

You can override the CI config path with the `--ci-config` option.

# supported options are "docker" and "podman"
container-engine: docker
# continue with analysis even if there are errors parsing the image archive
ignore-errors: false
log:
  enabled: true
  path: ./dive.log

dive will search for configs in the following locations:

-   `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dive/*.yaml`
-   `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/dive/*.yaml`
-   `~/.config/dive/*.yaml`
-   `~/.dive.yaml`

`.yml` can be used instead of `.yaml` if desired.
