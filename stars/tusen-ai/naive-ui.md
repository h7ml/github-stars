Features
--------

### Fairly Complete

There are more than 90 components. Hope they can help you write less code.

What's more, they are all treeshakable.

### Theme Customizable

We provide an advanced type safe theme system built using TypeScript. All you need is to provide a theme overrides object in JS. Then all the stuff will be done by us.

What's more, no less/sass/css variables, no webpack loaders are required.

### Uses TypeScript

All the stuff in Naive UI is written in TypeScript. It can work with your typescript project seamlessly.

What's more, you don't need to import any CSS to use the components.

### Fast

I try to make it not rather slow. At least select, tree, transfer, table and cascader work with virtual list.

What's more, ..., no more. Just enjoy it.
