A New Programming Paradigm to Reshape React Development.

🎉 Introduction
---------------

`@shined/react-use` aims to **reshape the new programming paradigm of React development**. It enhances development efficiency, fosters better programming habits, and reduces the reliance on `useEffect` and `useState` by offering a multitude of high-quality, semantic Hooks. It encourages developers to gradually adapt to a React development (programming) paradigm that prioritizes '**Hooks first**'.

Fundamentally, it's a **SSR (Server-Side Rendering) friendly**, **comprehensive**, and **highly optimized** React Hooks library that provides flexible and efficient Hook solutions, entirely developed in **TypeScript**, and comes with interactive documentation filled with rich examples 🔥.

It's primarily inspired by VueUse, while also drawing from react-use, ahooks, and many other outstanding libraries within the community. Special thanks to the open-source community, especially the authors of the aforementioned libraries, for their exceptional work and inspiration.

🚀 Features
-----------

-   **Flexibility**: Dependencies Collection, ElementTarget, Ref Getter, Pausable, and more.
-   **Tree-shakable**: Designed and delivered with ESM, import only what you need.
-   **Interactive Documentation**: Interactive documentation with live examples and Playground.
-   **Lightweight**: Boasts zero dependencies.
-   **SSR-friendly**: Ensures that all Hooks are compatible with Server-side Rendering (SSR).
-   **First-class TypeScript Support**: Written in TypeScript with well-named type definitions and JSDoc Comment.
-   **Comprehensive Testing**: Each Hook is rigorously tested with Vitest to ensure reliability and stability.

Visit the Get Started section to explore how it can be integrated into your project.

⚡️ Optimizations
----------------

-   **Safe State**: Implements a safe state strategy for all stateful Hooks, reducing bugs and unwanted behaviors.
-   **Stable functions**: Every exported function benefits from stabilization by default.
-   **Latest State**: Avoids the expired closure issues by using latest state internally.
-   **Reduced Unnecessary Rerenders**: Use Pausable instance to control the behavior of some Hooks optionally.
