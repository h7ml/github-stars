Fair is a dynamic framework designed for Flutter. Through the automatic conversion of native Dart source files by the Fair Compiler tool, the project can obtain the ability to dynamically update the Widget Tree and State.

The goal of creating Fair is to support updates through business bundles and JS distribution without the release of versions (Android, iOS, Web), similar to React Native. After integrating with Flutter Fair, you can quickly publish new pages without waiting for your app's next release date. Fair provides standard widgets, which can be used as a new dynamic page or as part of an existing Flutter page, such as typography/style modification of operation bits, full page replacement, partial replacement, etc.

Fair's UI rendering is lossless and can be restored at the pixel level. Take a look at the effect of escaping some pages of Best Flutter UI Templates:

üèõArchitecture
--------------

üöÄ Running
----------

Use Flutter Fair require few steps.

**step1Ôºödownload fair project source code**

It is recommended to download fair to the local and dependencies on the relative path.

The download method is as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/wuba/fair.git
```

**step2ÔºöAdd dependency inside `pubspec.yaml`**

Assuming that the fair project and your own project are in the same folder:

# add Fair dependency
dependencies:
  fair: 3.2.1

# add build\_runner and compiler dependency
dev\_dependencies:
  build\_runner: ^2.0.0
  fair\_compiler: ^1.7.0
 
# switch "fair\_version" according to the local Flutter SDK version
# Flutter SDK 3.7.x(3.7.0„ÄÅ3.7.1„ÄÅ3.7.2„ÄÅ3.7.3„ÄÅ3.7.4„ÄÅ3.7.5„ÄÅ3.7.6„ÄÅ3.7.7„ÄÅ3.7.8„ÄÅ3.7.9„ÄÅ3.7.10) -> flutter\_3\_7\_0
# Flutter SDK 3.3.x(3.3.0„ÄÅ3.3.1„ÄÅ3.3.2„ÄÅ3.3.3„ÄÅ3.3.4„ÄÅ3.3.5„ÄÅ3.3.6„ÄÅ3.3.7„ÄÅ3.3.8„ÄÅ3.3.9„ÄÅ3.3.10) -> flutter\_3\_3\_0
# Flutter SDK 3.0.x(3.0.0„ÄÅ3.0.1„ÄÅ3.0.2„ÄÅ3.0.3„ÄÅ3.0.4„ÄÅ3.0.5) -> flutter\_3\_0\_0
# Flutter SDK 2.10.x(2.10.0„ÄÅ2.10.1„ÄÅ2.10.2„ÄÅ2.10.3) -> flutter\_2\_10\_0
# Flutter SDK 2.8.x(2.8.0„ÄÅ2.8.1) -> flutter\_2\_8\_0
# Flutter SDK 2.5.x(2.5.0„ÄÅ2.5.1„ÄÅ2.5.2„ÄÅ2.5.3) -> flutter\_2\_5\_0
# Flutter SDK 2.0.6 -> flutter\_2\_0\_6
# Flutter SDK 1.22.6 -> flutter\_1\_22\_6
dependency\_overrides:
  fair\_version:
    path: ../fair/flutter\_version/flutter\_3\_7\_0

**step3ÔºöWrap your app with FairApp Widget**

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  FairApp.runApplication(
    \_getApp(),
    plugins: {
    },
  );
}

dynamic \_getApp() \=> FairApp(
  modules: {
  },
  delegate: {
  },
  child: MaterialApp(
    home: FairWidget(
            name: 'DynamicWidget',
            path: 'assets/bundle/lib\_src\_page\_dynamic\_widget.fair.json',
            data: {"fairProps": json.encode({})}),
  ),
);

**step4ÔºöImport a dynamic widget as FairWidget**

FairWidget(
  name: 'DynamicWidget',
  path: 'assets/bundle/lib\_src\_page\_dynamic\_widget.fair.json',
  data: {"fairProps": json.encode({})}),

DevTools

Fair-Online Platform
--------------------

Fair-Online is an integrated cloud development platform for Flutter developers, from online development of Flutter, to real-time compilation and preview, packaging and publishing, and dynamic release of end-side updates, to realize the dynamic online Flutter.

Developers do not need to configure the Flutter development environment, develop and debug code online, compile and preview in real time, and what you see is what you get. Combined with the Flutter dynamic framework Fair and the hot update platform FairPushy created by the 58 open source team, Flutter online dynamics are realized.
