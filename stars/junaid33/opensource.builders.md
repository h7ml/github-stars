Want to add a open-source project?
----------------------------------

There are 2 ways to add a new open-source project

1.  Go to http://localhost:8000/edit. You will see a blue pencil icon on the bottom left. When you click it, it opens TinaCMS. You can add comparisons and alternatives here and change the data on existing ones. Once done, the data is automatically saved and you can send a PR which I can preview and accept quickly.
2.  All the data is saved here:

https://github.com/junaid33/opensource.builders/blob/master/content/alts/alts.json

You can edit this JSON directly and send a PR if you don't want to run anything locally.

Want to add a request for open-source alternatives?
---------------------------------------------------

1.  Create an issue with the title being the name of the commercial software and the body being a small description
2.  Add the label "request" and give it the initial thumbs-up

What's the tech stack?
----------------------

1.  TinaCMS to add the comparisons and alternatives. They are kept as a JSON file.
2.  ChakraUI to style the website
3.  Github issues to handle new requests
