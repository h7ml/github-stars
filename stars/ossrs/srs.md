Usage
-----

Please check the Getting Started guide in English or Chinese. We highly recommend using SRS with docker:

docker run --rm -it -p 1935:1935 -p 1985:1985 -p 8080:8080 \\
    -p 8000:8000/udp -p 10080:10080/udp ossrs/srs:5

> Tips: If you're in China, use this image `registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/ossrs/srs:5` for faster speed.

Open http://localhost:8080/ to verify, and then stream using the following FFmpeg command:

ffmpeg -re -i ./doc/source.flv -c copy -f flv -y rtmp://localhost/live/livestream

Alternatively, stream by OBS using the following configuration:

-   Service: `Custom`
-   Server: `rtmp://localhost/live`
-   Stream Key: `livestream`

Play the following streams using media players:

-   To play an RTMP stream with URL `rtmp://localhost/live/livestream` on VLC player, open the player, go to Media > Open Network Stream, enter the URL and click Play.
-   You can play HTTP-FLV stream URL http://localhost:8080/live/livestream.flv on a webpage using the srs-player, an HTML5-based player.
-   Use srs-player for playing HLS stream with URL http://localhost:8080/live/livestream.m3u8.

If you'd like to use WebRTC, convert RTMP to WebRTC, or convert WebRTC to RTMP, please check out the wiki documentation in either English or Chinese.

To learn more about RTMP, HLS, HTTP-FLV, SRT, MPEG-DASH, WebRTC protocols, clustering, HTTP API, DVR, and transcoding, please check the documents in English or Chinese.
