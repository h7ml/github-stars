‚ú® tailwindcss-motion ‚ú®
======================

tailwindcss-motion is a Tailwind CSS Plugin made at RomboHQ. It‚Äôs a simple, yet powerful, animation library with a simple syntax.

_Motion, without commotion._

‚öíÔ∏è Installation
---------------

**1\. Install npm package**

npm i -D tailwindcss-motion

**2\. Add into your tailwind.config.js**

// tailwind.config.js

export default {
     content: \[...\],
     theme: {
        extend: {...},
     },
     plugins: \[require('tailwindcss-motion')\],
};

**or,** to use ESM:

import tailwindcssMotion from "tailwindcss-motion";

/\*\* @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} \*/
export default {
     content: \[...\],
     theme: {
          extend: {},
     },
     plugins: \[tailwindcssMotion\],
};

How does it work?
-----------------

We provide a simple syntax to animate any element in your Tailwind project. Instead of defining custom keyframes, we provide utility classes to animate every dimension, inline.

For example, for a slide and fade effect ‚Äî you simply need `motion-translate-x-in-25 motion-opacity-in-0` or, you can use one of our presets with `motion-preset-fade`
