Vitess
======

Vitess is a cloud-native horizontally-scalable distributed database system that is built around MySQL. Vitess can achieve unlimited scaling through generalized sharding.

Vitess allows application code and database queries to remain agnostic to the distribution of data onto multiple database servers. With Vitess, you can even split and merge shards as your needs grow, with an atomic cutover step that takes only a few seconds.

Vitess was a core component of YouTube's database infrastructure from 2011, and grew to encompass tens of thousands of MySQL nodes. Starting in 2015, Vitess was adopted by many other large companies, including Slack, Square (now Block), and JD.com.
