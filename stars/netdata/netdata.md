WHO WE ARE
----------

Netdata is an open-source, real-time infrastructure monitoring platform. Monitor, detect, and act across your entire infrastructure.

**Core Advantages:**

-   **Instant Insights** – With Netdata you can access per-second metrics and visualizations.
-   **Zero Configuration** – You can deploy immediately without complex setup.
-   **ML-Powered** – You can detect anomalies, predict issues, and automate analysis.
-   **Efficient** – You can monitor with minimal resource usage and maximum scalability.
-   **Secure & Distributed** – You can keep your data local with no central collection needed.

With Netdata, you get real-time, per-second updates. Clear **insights at a glance**, no complexity.

**All heroes have a great origin story. Click to discover ours.**  

In 2013, at the company where Costa Tsaousis was COO, a significant percentage of their cloud-based transactions failed silently, severely impacting business performance.

Costa and his team tried every troubleshooting tool available at the time. None could identify the root cause. As Costa later wrote:

“_I couldn’t believe that monitoring systems provide so few metrics and with such low resolution, scale so badly, and cost so much to run._”

Frustrated, he decided to build his own monitoring tool, starting from scratch.

That decision led to countless late nights and weekends. It also sparked a fundamental shift in how infrastructure monitoring and troubleshooting are approached, both in method and in cost.

### Most Energy-Efficient Monitoring Tool

According to the University of Amsterdam study, Netdata is the most energy-efficient tool for monitoring Docker-based systems. The study also shows Netdata excels in CPU usage, RAM usage, and execution time compared to other monitoring solutions.

Getting Started
---------------

You can install Netdata on all major operating systems. To begin:

### 1\. Install Netdata

Choose your platform and follow the installation guide:

-   Linux Installation
-   macOS
-   FreeBSD
-   Windows
-   Docker Guide
-   Kubernetes Setup

Note

You can access the Netdata UI at `http://localhost:19999` (or `http://NODE:19999` if remote).

### 2\. Configure Collectors

Netdata auto-discovers most metrics, but you can manually configure some collectors:

-   All collectors
-   SNMP monitoring

### 3\. Configure Alerts

You can use hundreds of built-in alerts and integrate with:

`email`, `Slack`, `Telegram`, `PagerDuty`, `Discord`, `Microsoft Teams`, and more.

Note

Email alerts work by default if there's a configured MTA.

### 4\. Configure Parents

You can centralize dashboards, alerts, and storage with Netdata Parents:

-   Streaming Reference

Note

You can use Netdata Parents for central dashboards, longer retention, and alert configuration.

### 5\. Connect to Netdata Cloud

Sign in to Netdata Cloud and connect your nodes for:

-   Access from anywhere
-   Horizontal scalability and multi-node dashboards
-   UI configuration for alerts and data collection
-   Role-based access control
-   Free tier available

Note

Netdata Cloud is optional. Your data stays in your infrastructure.

Loading

With each Agent you can:

1.  **Collect** – Gather metrics from systems, containers, apps, logs, APIs, and synthetic checks.
2.  **Store** – Save metrics to a high-efficiency, tiered time-series database.
3.  **Learn** – Train ML models per metric using recent behavior.
4.  **Detect** – Identify anomalies using trained ML models.
5.  **Check** – Evaluate metrics against pre-set or custom alert rules.
6.  **Stream** – Send metrics to Netdata Parents in real time.
7.  **Archive** – Export metrics to Prometheus, InfluxDB, OpenTSDB, Graphite, and others.
8.  **Query** – Access metrics via an API for dashboards or third-party tools.
9.  **Score** – Use a scoring engine to find patterns and correlations across metrics.

FAQ
---

**Is Netdata secure?**  

Yes. Netdata follows OpenSSF best practices, has a security-first design, and is regularly audited by the community.

-   Security design
-   Security policies and advisories

**Does Netdata use a lot of resources?**  

No. Even with ML and per-second metrics, Netdata uses minimal resources.

-   ~5% CPU and 150MiB RAM by default on production systems
-   <1% CPU and ~100MiB RAM when ML and alerts are disabled and using ephemeral storage
-   Parents scale to millions of metrics per second with appropriate hardware

> You can use the **Netdata Monitoring** section in the dashboard to inspect its resource usage.

**How much data retention is possible?**  

As much as your disk allows.

With Netdata you can use tiered retention:

-   Tier 0: per-second resolution
-   Tier 1: per-minute resolution
-   Tier 2: per-hour resolution

These are queried automatically based on the zoom level.

**Can Netdata scale to many servers?**  

Yes. With Netdata you can:

-   Scale horizontally with many Agents
-   Scale vertically with powerful Parents
-   Scale infinitely via Netdata Cloud

> You can use Netdata Cloud to merge many independent infrastructures into one logical view.

**Is disk I/O a concern?**  

No. Netdata minimizes disk usage:

-   Metrics are flushed to disk every 17 minutes, spread out evenly
-   Uses direct I/O and compression (ZSTD)
-   Can run entirely in RAM or stream to a Parent

> You can use `alloc` or `ram` mode for no disk writes.

**How is Netdata different from Prometheus + Grafana?**  

With Netdata you get a complete monitoring solution—not just tools.

-   No manual setup or dashboards needed
-   Built-in ML, alerts, dashboards, and correlations
-   More efficient and easier to deploy

> Performance comparison

**How is Netdata different from commercial SaaS tools?**  

With Netdata you can store all metrics on your infrastructure—no sampling, no aggregation, no loss.

-   High-resolution metrics by default
-   ML per metric, not shared models
-   Unlimited scalability without skyrocketing cost

**Can Netdata run alongside Nagios, Zabbix, etc.?**  

Yes. You can use Netdata together with traditional tools.

With Netdata you get:

-   Real-time, high-resolution monitoring
-   Zero configuration and auto-generated dashboards
-   Anomaly detection and advanced visualization

**What if I feel overwhelmed?**  

You can start small:

-   Use the dashboard's table of contents and search
-   Explore anomaly scoring ("AR" toggle)
-   Create custom dashboards in Netdata Cloud

> Docs and guides

**Do I have to use Netdata Cloud?**  

No. Netdata Cloud is optional.

Netdata works without it, but with Cloud you can:

-   Access remotely with SSO
-   Save dashboard customizations
-   Configure alerts centrally
-   Collaborate with role-based access

**What telemetry does Netdata collect?**  

Anonymous telemetry helps improve the product. You can disable it:

-   Add `--disable-telemetry` to the installer, or
-   Create `/etc/netdata/.opt-out-from-anonymous-statistics` and restart Netdata

> Telemetry helps us understand usage, not track users. No private data is collected.

**Who uses Netdata?**  

You'll join users including:

-   Major companies (Amazon, ABN AMRO Bank, Facebook, Google, IBM, Intel, Netflix, Samsung)
-   Universities (NYU, Columbia, Seoul National, UCL)
-   Government organizations worldwide
-   Infrastructure-intensive organizations
-   Technology operators
-   Startups and freelancers
-   SysAdmins and DevOps professionals
