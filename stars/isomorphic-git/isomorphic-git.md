isomorphic-git
==============

`isomorphic-git` is a pure JavaScript reimplementation of git that works in both Node.js and browser JavaScript environments. It can read and write to git repositories, fetch from and push to git remotes (such as GitHub), all without any native C++ module dependencies.

Goals
-----

Isomorphic-git aims for 100% interoperability with the canonical git implementation. This means it does all its operations by modifying files in a ".git" directory just like the git you are used to. The included `isogit` CLI can operate on git repositories on your desktop or server.

This library aims to be a complete solution with no assembly required. The API has been designed with modern tools like Rollup and Webpack in mind. By providing functionality as individual functions, code bundlers can produce smaller bundles by including only the functions your application uses.

The project includes type definitions so you can enjoy static type-checking and intelligent code completion in editors like VS Code and CodeSandbox.

Project status
--------------

The original author of the project (Billie Hilton) left the project, but the project is still maintained by two volunteers:

-   @jcubic (most active)
-   @mojavelinux

But they don't write much code, mainly do code review and try to answer to issues and on Gitter, they just don't want the project to die. So you can say that this project is community driven (as jcubic always reply to issues). Which means that if you want a feature to be implemented you need to do this yourself or find someone that is willing to write the code for you. The project have some money on OpenCollective and we can spend it on some development, if you find someone that is willing to code in exchange to some bucks (it may be you), but we don't have a lot so don't expect to have full sallary.

If you want to help this project you're more than welcome to do so.

Upgrading from version 0.x to version 1.x?
------------------------------------------

See the full Release Notes on GitHub and the release Blog Post.

Install
-------

You can install it from npm:

```
npm install --save isomorphic-git
```

Getting Started
---------------

The "isomorphic" in `isomorphic-git` means that the same code runs in either the server or the browser. That's tricky to do since git uses the file system and makes HTTP requests. Browsers don't have an `fs` module. And node and browsers have different APIs for making HTTP requests!

So rather than relying on the `fs` and `http` modules, `isomorphic-git` lets you bring your own file system and HTTP client.

If you're using `isomorphic-git` in node, you use the native `fs` module and the provided node HTTP client.

// node.js example
const path \= require('path')
const git \= require('isomorphic-git')
const http \= require('isomorphic-git/http/node')
const fs \= require('fs')

const dir \= path.join(process.cwd(), 'test-clone')
git.clone({ fs, http, dir, url: 'https://github.com/isomorphic-git/lightning-fs' }).then(console.log)

If you're using `isomorphic-git` in the browser, you'll need something that emulates the `fs` API. The easiest to setup and most performant library is LightningFS which is written and maintained by the same author and is part of the `isomorphic-git` suite. If LightningFS doesn't meet your requirements, isomorphic-git should also work with BrowserFS and Filer. Instead of `isomorphic-git/http/node` this time import `isomorphic-git/http/web`:

<script src\="https://unpkg.com/@isomorphic-git/lightning-fs"\></script\>
<script src\="https://unpkg.com/isomorphic-git"\></script\>
<script type\="module"\>
import http from 'https://unpkg.com/isomorphic-git@beta/http/web/index.js'
const fs \= new LightningFS('fs')

const dir \= '/test-clone'
git.clone({ fs, http, dir, url: 'https://github.com/isomorphic-git/lightning-fs', corsProxy: 'https://cors.isomorphic-git.org' }).then(console.log)
</script\>

If you're using ES module syntax, you can use either the default import for convenience, or named imports to benefit from tree-shaking if you are using a bundler:

import git from 'isomorphic-git'
// or
import \* as git from 'isomorphic-git'
// or
import {plugins, clone, commit, push} from 'isomorphic-git'

### CORS support

Unfortunately, due to the same-origin policy by default `isomorphic-git` can only clone from the same origin as the webpage it is running on. This is terribly inconvenient, as it means for all practical purposes cloning and pushing repos must be done through a proxy.

For this purpose @isomorphic-git/cors-proxy exists which you can clone or `npm install`. For testing or small projects, you can also use https://cors.isomorphic-git.org - a free proxy sponsored by Clever Cloud.

We hope to get CORS headers added to all the major Git hosting platforms eventually, and will list the progress made here:

Service

Supports CORS requests

Gogs (self-hosted)

✔

Gitea (self-hosted)

✔

Azure DevOps

✔ (Usage Note: requires authentication)

Gitlab

❌ Our PR was rejected, but the issue is still open!

Bitbucket

❌

Github

❌

It is literally just two lines of code to add the CORS headers!! Easy stuff. Surely it will happen.

### `isogit` CLI

Isomorphic-git comes with a simple CLI tool, named `isogit` because `isomorphic-git` is a lot to type. It is really just a thin shell that translates command line arguments into the equivalent JS API commands. So you should be able to run _any_ current or future isomorphic-git commands using the CLI.

It always starts with an the assumption that the current working directory is a git root. E.g. `{ dir: '.' }`.

It uses `minimisted` to parse command line options and will print out the equivalent JS command and pretty-print the output JSON.

The CLI is more of a lark for quickly testing `isomorphic-git` and isn't really meant as a `git` CLI replacement.

Supported Git commands

Contributing to `isomorphic-git`
--------------------------------

The development setup is similar to that of a large web application. The main difference is the ridiculous amount of hacks involved in the tests. We use Facebook's Jest for testing, which make doing TDD fast and fun, but we also used custom hacks so that the same tests will also run in the browser using Jasmine via Karma. We even have our own mock server for serving git repository test fixtures!

You'll need node.js installed, but everything else is a devDependency.

git clone https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git
cd isomorphic-git
npm install
npm test

Acknowledgments
---------------

Isomorphic-git would not have been possible without the pioneering work by @creationix and @chrisdickinson. Git is a tricky binary mess, and without their examples (and their modules!) we would not have been able to come even close to finishing this. They are geniuses ahead of their time.
