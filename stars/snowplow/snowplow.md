As of January 8, 2024, Snowplow introduced the Snowplow Limited Use License Agreement, and we are releasing new versions of our core pipeline technology under this license. There will be no security patches made to versions of our software that pre-date January 2024.

If you are currently using the pipeline in production, or in a way that is competitive with Snowplow, these changes affect you. If you wish to use the current version of Snowplow software, please contact us to discuss a plan that works for you.

We value all of our users and remain dedicated to helping our community use Snowplow in the optimal capacity that fits their business goals and needs.
