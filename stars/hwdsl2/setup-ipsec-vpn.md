IPsec VPN Server Auto Setup Scripts
===================================

Set up your own IPsec VPN server in just a few minutes, with IPsec/L2TP, Cisco IPsec and IKEv2.

An IPsec VPN encrypts your network traffic, so that nobody between you and the VPN server can eavesdrop on your data as it travels via the Internet. This is especially useful when using unsecured networks, e.g. at coffee shops, airports or hotel rooms.

We will use Libreswan as the IPsec server, and xl2tpd as the L2TP provider.

Quick start
-----------

First, prepare your Linux server\* with an install of Ubuntu, Debian or CentOS.

Use this one-liner to set up an IPsec VPN server:

wget https://get.vpnsetup.net -O vpn.sh && sudo sh vpn.sh

Your VPN login details will be randomly generated, and displayed when finished.

**Optional:** Install WireGuard and/or OpenVPN on the same server.

See the script in action (terminal recording).

**Note:** This recording is for demo purposes only. VPN credentials in this recording are **NOT** valid.

¬† ¬† ¬†

**¬ª I want to run my own VPN but don't have a server for that**

For servers with an external firewall (e.g. EC2/GCE), open UDP ports 500 and 4500 for the VPN.

A pre-built Docker image is also available. Advanced users can install on a Raspberry Pi. \[1\] \[2\]

‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT** run these scripts on your PC or Mac! They should only be used on a server!

Installation
------------

First, update your server with `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade` (Ubuntu/Debian) or `sudo yum update` and reboot. This is optional, but recommended.

To install the VPN, please choose one of the following options:

**Option 1:** Have the script generate random VPN credentials for you (will be displayed when finished).

wget https://get.vpnsetup.net -O vpn.sh && sudo sh vpn.sh

**Option 2:** Edit the script and provide your own VPN credentials.

wget https://get.vpnsetup.net -O vpn.sh
nano -w vpn.sh
\[Replace with your own values: YOUR\_IPSEC\_PSK, YOUR\_USERNAME and YOUR\_PASSWORD\]
sudo sh vpn.sh

**Note:** A secure IPsec PSK should consist of at least 20 random characters.

**Option 3:** Define your VPN credentials as environment variables.

# All values MUST be placed inside 'single quotes'
# DO NOT use these special characters within values: \\ " '
wget https://get.vpnsetup.net -O vpn.sh
sudo VPN\_IPSEC\_PSK='your\_ipsec\_pre\_shared\_key' \\
VPN\_USER='your\_vpn\_username' \\
VPN\_PASSWORD='your\_vpn\_password' \\
sh vpn.sh

You may optionally install WireGuard and/or OpenVPN on the same server. If your server runs CentOS Stream, Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux, first install OpenVPN/WireGuard, then install the IPsec VPN.

You may also use `curl` to download. For example:

curl -fL https://get.vpnsetup.net -o vpn.sh
sudo sh vpn.sh

Alternative setup URLs:

https://gitlab.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn/-/raw/master/vpnsetup.sh

If you are unable to download, open vpnsetup.sh, then click the `Raw` button on the right. Press `Ctrl/Cmd+A` to select all, `Ctrl/Cmd+C` to copy, then paste into your favorite editor.

I want to install the older Libreswan version 4.

It is generally recommended to use the latest Libreswan version 5, which is the default version in this project. However, if you want to install the older Libreswan version 4:

wget https://get.vpnsetup.net -O vpn.sh
sudo VPN\_SWAN\_VER=4.15 sh vpn.sh

**Note:** If Libreswan version 5 is already installed, you may need to first Uninstall the VPN before installing Libreswan version 4. Alternatively, download the update script, edit it to specify `SWAN_VER=4.15`, then run the script.

Customize VPN options
---------------------

### Use alternative DNS servers

By default, clients are set to use Google Public DNS when the VPN is active. When installing the VPN, you may optionally specify custom DNS server(s) for all VPN modes. Example:

sudo VPN\_DNS\_SRV1=1.1.1.1 VPN\_DNS\_SRV2=1.0.0.1 sh vpn.sh

Use `VPN_DNS_SRV1` to specify the primary DNS server, and `VPN_DNS_SRV2` to specify the secondary DNS server (optional).

Below is a list of some popular public DNS providers for your reference.

If you need to change DNS servers after VPN setup, see Advanced usage.

**Note:** If IKEv2 is already set up on the server, the variables above have no effect for IKEv2 mode. In that case, to customize IKEv2 options such as DNS servers, you can first remove IKEv2, then set it up again using `sudo ikev2.sh`.

### Customize IKEv2 options

When installing the VPN, advanced users can optionally customize IKEv2 options.

Option 1: Skip IKEv2 during VPN setup, then set up IKEv2 using custom options.

When installing the VPN, you can skip IKEv2 and only install the IPsec/L2TP and IPsec/XAuth ("Cisco IPsec") modes:

sudo VPN\_SKIP\_IKEV2=yes sh vpn.sh

(Optional) If you want to specify custom DNS server(s) for VPN clients, define `VPN_DNS_SRV1` and optionally `VPN_DNS_SRV2`. See Use alternative DNS servers for details.

After that, run the IKEv2 helper script to set up IKEv2 interactively using custom options:

sudo ikev2.sh

You can customize the following options: VPN server's DNS name, name and validity period of the first client, DNS server for VPN clients and whether to password protect client config files.

**Note:** The `VPN_SKIP_IKEV2` variable has no effect if IKEv2 is already set up on the server. In that case, to customize IKEv2 options, you can first remove IKEv2, then set it up again using `sudo ikev2.sh`.

Option 2: Customize IKEv2 options using environment variables.

When installing the VPN, you can optionally specify a DNS name for the IKEv2 server address. The DNS name must be a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). Example:

sudo VPN\_DNS\_NAME='vpn.example.com' sh vpn.sh

Similarly, you may specify a name for the first IKEv2 client. The default is `vpnclient` if not specified.

sudo VPN\_CLIENT\_NAME='your\_client\_name' sh vpn.sh

By default, clients are set to use Google Public DNS when the VPN is active. You may specify custom DNS server(s) for all VPN modes. Example:

sudo VPN\_DNS\_SRV1=1.1.1.1 VPN\_DNS\_SRV2=1.0.0.1 sh vpn.sh

By default, no password is required when importing IKEv2 client configuration. You can choose to protect client config files using a random password.

sudo VPN\_PROTECT\_CONFIG=yes sh vpn.sh

Important notes
---------------

**Windows users**: For IPsec/L2TP mode, a one-time registry change is required if the VPN server or client is behind NAT (e.g. home router).

The same VPN account can be used by your multiple devices. However, due to an IPsec/L2TP limitation, if you wish to connect multiple devices from behind the same NAT (e.g. home router), you must use IKEv2 or IPsec/XAuth mode. To view or update VPN user accounts, see Manage VPN users.

For servers with an external firewall (e.g. EC2/GCE), open UDP ports 500 and 4500 for the VPN. Aliyun users, see #433.

Clients are set to use Google Public DNS when the VPN is active. If another DNS provider is preferred, see Advanced usage.

Using kernel support could improve IPsec/L2TP performance. It is available on all supported OS. Ubuntu users should install the `linux-modules-extra-$(uname -r)` package and run `service xl2tpd restart`.

The scripts will backup existing config files before making changes, with `.old-date-time` suffix.
