Outline Server
==============

Outline Server is the component that provides the Shadowsocks service (via outline-ss-server) and a service management API. You can deploy this server directly following simple instructions in this repository, or if you prefer a ready-to-use graphical interface you can use the Outline Manager.

**Components:**

-   **Outline Server** (`src/shadowbox`): The core proxy server that runs and manages outline-ss-server, a Shadowsocks backend. It provides a REST API for access key management.
    
-   **Metrics Server** (`src/metrics_server`): A REST service for optional, anonymous metrics sharing.

Shadowsocks and Anti-Censorship
-------------------------------

Outline's use of Shadowsocks means it benefits from ongoing improvements that strengthen its resistance against detection and blocking.

**Key Protections:**

-   **AEAD ciphers** are mandatory.
-   **Probing resistance** mitigates detection techniques.
-   **Protection against replayed data.**
-   **Variable packet sizes** to hinder identification.

See Shadowsocks resistance against detection and blocking.
