Dust
====

du + rust = dust. Like du but more intuitive.

Why
===

Because I want an easy way to see where my disk is being used.

Demo
====

Install
-------

#### Cargo

-   `cargo install du-dust`

#### üç∫ Homebrew (Mac OS)

-   `brew install dust`

#### üç∫ Homebrew (Linux)

-   `brew install dust`

#### Snap Ubuntu and supported systems

-   `snap install dust`

Note: `dust` installed through `snap` can only access files stored in the `/home` directory. See danie-dejager/dust-snap#2 for more information.

#### Pacstall (Debian/Ubuntu)

-   `pacstall -I dust-bin`

#### Anaconda (conda-forge)

-   `conda install -c conda-forge dust`

#### deb-get (Debian/Ubuntu)

-   `deb-get install du-dust`

#### x-cmd

-   `x env use dust`

#### Windows:

-   `scoop install dust`
-   Windows GNU version - works
-   Windows MSVC - requires: VCRUNTIME140.dll

#### Download

-   Download Linux/Mac binary from Releases
-   unzip file: `tar -xvf _downloaded_file.tar.gz`
-   move file to executable path: `sudo mv dust /usr/local/bin/`

Overview
--------

Dust is meant to give you an instant overview of which directories are using disk space without requiring sort or head. Dust will print a maximum of one 'Did not have permissions message'.

Dust will list a slightly-less-than-the-terminal-height number of the biggest subdirectories or files and will smartly recurse down the tree to find the larger ones. There is no need for a '-d' flag or a '-h' flag. The largest subdirectories will be colored.

The different colors on the bars: These represent the combined tree hierarchy & disk usage. The shades of grey are used to indicate which parent folder a subfolder belongs to. For instance, look at the above screenshot. `.steam` is a folder taking 44% of the space. From the `.steam` bar is a light grey line that goes up. All these folders are inside `.steam` so if you delete `.steam` all that stuff will be gone too.

Usage
-----

```
Usage: dust
Usage: dust <dir>
Usage: dust <dir>  <another_dir> <and_more>
Usage: dust -p (full-path - Show fullpath of the subdirectories)
Usage: dust -s (apparent-size - shows the length of the file as opposed to the amount of disk space it uses)
Usage: dust -n 30  (Shows 30 directories instead of the default [default is terminal height])
Usage: dust -d 3  (Shows 3 levels of subdirectories)
Usage: dust -D (Show only directories (eg dust -D))
Usage: dust -F (Show only files - finds your largest files)
Usage: dust -r (reverse order of output)
Usage: dust -o si/b/kb/kib/mb/mib/gb/gib (si - prints sizes in powers of 1000. Others print size in that format).
Usage: dust -X ignore  (ignore all files and directories with the name 'ignore')
Usage: dust -x (Only show directories on the same filesystem)
Usage: dust -b (Do not show percentages or draw ASCII bars)
Usage: dust -B (--bars-on-right - Percent bars moved to right side of screen)
Usage: dust -i (Do not show hidden files)
Usage: dust -c (No colors [monochrome])
Usage: dust -C (Force colors)
Usage: dust -f (Count files instead of diskspace [Counts by inode, to include duplicate inodes use dust -f -s])
Usage: dust -t (Group by filetype)
Usage: dust -z 10M (min-size, Only include files larger than 10M)
Usage: dust -e regex (Only include files matching this regex (eg dust -e "\.png$" would match png files))
Usage: dust -v regex (Exclude files matching this regex (eg dust -v "\.png$" would ignore png files))
Usage: dust -L (dereference-links - Treat sym links as directories and go into them)
Usage: dust -P (Disable the progress indicator)
Usage: dust -R (For screen readers. Removes bars/symbols. Adds new column: depth level. (May want to use -p for full path too))
Usage: dust -S (Custom Stack size - Use if you see: 'fatal runtime error: stack overflow' (default allocation: low memory=1048576, high memory=1073741824)"),
Usage: dust --skip-total (No total row will be displayed)
Usage: dust -z 40000/30MB/20kib (Exclude output files/directories below size 40000 bytes / 30MB / 20KiB)
Usage: dust -j (Prints JSON representation of directories, try: dust -j  | jq)
Usage: dust --files0-from=FILE (Read NUL-terminated file paths from FILE; if FILE is '-', read from stdin)
Usage: dust --files-from=FILE (Read newline-terminated file paths from FILE; if FILE is '-', read from stdin)
Usage: dust --collapse=node-modules will keep the node-modules folder collapsed in display instead of recursively opening it
```

Config file
-----------

Dust has a config file where the above options can be set. Either: `~/.config/dust/config.toml` or `~/.dust.toml`

```
$ cat ~/.config/dust/config.toml
reverse=true
```

Alternatives
------------

-   NCDU
-   dutree
-   dua
-   pdu
-   dirstat-rs
-   `du -d 1 -h | sort -h`

Note: Apparent-size is calculated slightly differently in dust to gdu. In dust each hard link is counted as using file\_length space. In gdu only the first entry is counted.
