How to build your tool
----------------------

#### 🎯 Step 1: Connect to your database

#### 🎨 Step 2: Build UI with built-in components

Build your UI by dragging components to the canvas. We provide dozens of components including charts, tables, forms, and many more in Illa Builder and Illa Design. When components overlap, their position will be automatically adjusted, which makes the layout development easy and flexible.

#### 🔌 Step 3: Connect to your data

Connect to MySQL or REST API through our GUI data connectors. We will add more than 10 databases and APIs soon.

#### 🚀 Step 4: Deploy your app

Deploy your app and self-host it.
