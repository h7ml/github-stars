API
---

type(target: HTMLElement, ...steps: any\[\]) \=\> Promise<void\>;

The module exports a single function, `type`, which takes a target element as its first argument, and any number of additional arguments as the steps to perform. Additional arguments perform actions based on their type:

Type

Action

`string`

Type text

`number`

Pause (milliseconds)

`function`

Call with target element

`Promise`

Wait for resolution

Usage
-----

The most basic usage of `type` is providing a target element and a string to type.

import { type } from '@camwiegert/typical';

type(element, 'text');

### Pausing

In order to pause typing at any point, pass a number of milliseconds to pause.

type(element, 'Hello', 1000, 'Hello world!');

### Looping

In order to loop, pass `type` as a parameter to itself at the point at which you'd like to start looping. It can be helpful to alias `type` as `loop` to be explicit.

import {
    type,
    type as loop
};

const steps \= \[1000, 'Ready', 1000, 'Set', 1000, 'Go'\];

type(element, ...steps, loop);

To loop a finite amount, pass your steps multiple times.

type(element, ...steps, ...steps, ...steps);

### Waiting

When passed a `Promise`, `type` will wait for it to resolve before continuing. Because `type` itself returns a `Promise`, that means you can wait on a set of steps to complete before starting another.

const init \= type(target, 'In a moment...', 500);

type(target, init, 'start', 500, 'looping', loop);

### Functions

Function arguments are passed the target element, and can be useful for operating on the target element between steps. If you return a `Promise`, `type` will wait for it to resolve.

const toggle \= (element) \=>
    element.classList.toggle('is-typing');

type(target, toggle, 'Type me', toggle);
