##### GPU-powered, highly performant large-scale data visualization

deck.gl is designed to simplify high-performance, WebGL2/WebGPU based visualization of large data sets. Users can quickly get impressive visual results with minimal effort by composing existing layers, or leverage deck.gl's extensible architecture to address custom needs.

deck.gl maps **data** (usually an array of JSON objects) into a stack of visual **layers** - e.g. icons, polygons, texts; and look at them with **views**: e.g. map, first-person, orthographic.

deck.gl handles a number of challenges out of the box:

-   Performant rendering and updating of large data sets
-   Interactive event handling such as picking, highlighting and filtering
-   Cartographic projections and integration with major basemap providers
-   A catalog of proven, well-tested layers

Deck.gl is designed to be highly customizable. All layers come with flexible APIs to allow programmatic control of each aspect of the rendering. All core classes such are easily extendable by the users to address custom use cases.
