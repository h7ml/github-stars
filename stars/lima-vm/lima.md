Lima: Linux Machines
====================

Lima launches Linux virtual machines with automatic file sharing and port forwarding (similar to WSL2).

The original goal of Lima was to promote containerd including nerdctl (contaiNERD ctl) to Mac users, but Lima can be used for non-container applications as well.

Lima also supports other container engines (Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, etc.) and non-macOS hosts (Linux, NetBSD, etc.).

Getting started
---------------

Set up (Homebrew):

brew install lima
limactl start

To run Linux commands:

lima uname -a

To run containers with containerd:

lima nerdctl run --rm hello-world

To run containers with Docker:

limactl start template://docker
export DOCKER\_HOST=$(limactl list docker --format 'unix://{{.Dir}}/sock/docker.sock')
docker run --rm hello-world

To run containers with Kubernetes:

limactl start template://k8s
export KUBECONFIG=$(limactl list k8s --format 'unix://{{.Dir}}/copied-from-guest/kubeconfig.yaml')
kubectl apply -f ...

See https://lima-vm.io/docs/ for the further information.
