> A tiny (130B to 205B) and fast utility to randomize unique IDs of fixed length

_**Fast object IDs.** Available for Node.js and the browser._  
Generate **randomized** output strings of fixed length using lowercase alphanumeric characters (`a-z0-9`). To produce IDs in UUID.V4 format, please see `@lukeed/uuid`.

This module offers multiple modes for your needs:

-   `uid`  
    _The default is "non-secure", which uses `Math.random` to produce UUIDs._
-   `uid/secure`  
    _The "secure" mode produces cryptographically secure (CSPRNG) UUIDs using the current environment's `crypto` module._
-   `uid/single`  
    _The "single" mode does not maintain an internal cache, which makes it ideal for short-lived environments._

Additionally, this module is preconfigured for native ESM support in Node.js with fallback to CommonJS. It will also work with any Rollup and webpack configuration, regardless of the "mode" selected.

Install
-------

```
$ npm install --save uid
```

Modes
-----

There are three "versions" of `uid` available:

#### `uid`

> **Size (gzip):** 174 bytes  
> **Availability:** CommonJS, ES Module, UMD

Relies on `Math.random`, which means that, while faster, this mode **is not** cryptographically secure.  
Works in Node.js and all browsers.  
Alphabet: _**Hexadecimal**_

#### `uid/secure`

> **Size (gzip):** 205 bytes  
> **Availability:** CommonJS, ES Module, UMD

Relies on the environment's `crypto` module in order to produce cryptographically secure (CSPRNG) values.  
Works in all versions of Node.js. Works in all browsers with `crypto.getRandomValues()` support.  
Alphabet: _**Hexadecimal**_

#### `uid/single`

> **Size (gzip):** 131 bytes  
> **Availability:** CommonJS, ES Module, UMD

Relies on `Math.random`, which means that this mode **is not** cryptographically secure.  
Does **not** maintain an internal buffer, which makes this mode ideal for single-use and/or short-lived environments.  
Works in Node.js and all browsers.  
Alphabet: _**Alphanumeric**_

Usage
-----

import { uid } from 'uid';
// or: import { uid } from 'uid/secure';
// or: import { uid } from 'uid/single';

// length = 11 (default)
uid(); //=> 'c92054d1dd6'
uid(); //=> 'ac84bbb3728'

// customize length
uid(16); //=> '8234dbf9a7dcec3b'
uid(25); //=> '4bbb3728b7a00a12209ec5ff5'
uid(32); //=> 'dcbc3e65506a7e6f15d30a357e884432'

API
---

### uid(length?)

Returns: `String`

Creates a new random identifer of fixed length.

#### length

Type: `Number`  
Default: `11`

Then length of the output string.

> **Important:** Your risk of collisions decreases with longer strings!

Benchmarks
----------

You can run the benchmark(s) yourself via the `/bench` directory.

All items listed pass a validation step for length and uniqueness.  
Items marked with a `†` are cryptographically secure (via CSPRNG).

Performance
-----------

The reason `uid` and `uid/secure` are so much faster than its alternatives is two-fold:

1.  It composes an output with hexadecimal pairs (from a cached dictionary) instead of single characters.
2.  It allocates a larger Buffer/ArrayBuffer up front (expensive) and slices off chunks as needed (cheap).

The `uid/secure` module maintains an internal ArrayBuffer of 4096 bytes, which supplies **256** `uid()` invocations. However, the default module (`uid`) preallocates **512** invocations using less memory upfront. Both implementations will regenerate its internal allocation as needed.

Larger buffers would result in higher performance over time, but I found these to be a good balance of performance and memory space.

> **Note:** If you want to don't want to preallocate memory, and do not need a CSPRNG, check out the `uid/single` mode.
