About
-----

Editor.js is an open-source text editor offering a variety of features to help users create and format content efficiently. It has a modern, block-style interface that allows users to easily add and arrange different types of content, such as text, images, lists, quotes, etc. Each Block is provided via a separate plugin making Editor.js extremely flexible.

Editor.js outputs a clean JSON data instead of heavy HTML markup. Use it in Web, iOS, Android, AMP, Instant Articles, speech readers, AI chatbots — everywhere. Easy to sanitize, extend and integrate with your logic.
