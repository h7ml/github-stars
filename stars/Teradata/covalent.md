Covalent Design System
======================

Covalent is Teradata's design system used to create consistent, branded experiences. This repository provides tools and components to support developers building applications for Teradata products. We currently support Angular and offer a comprehensive library of web components.

**Vision: To build an atomic, reusable component platform for Teradata to consume, while collaborating in an open source model.**

Using this workspace with VS code and NX
----------------------------------------

-   Covalent uses Nx for monorepo builds and task running.
-   For a better experience, install the Nx Console extension for VS Code.
-   **Nx Console** lets you:
    -   Run builds, tests, lint, and affected commands with a click.
    -   Generate libraries, components, and schematics interactively.
    -   Explore project/dependency graphs visually.
    -   Edit workspace configs quickly.
-   **Get started:**
    1.  Open the repo in VS Code.
    2.  Install Nx Console from the Extensions Marketplace.
    3.  Use the Nx Console sidebar or search Nx commands in the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`).
