Tesseract.js is a javascript library that gets words in almost any language out of images. (Demo)

Image Recognition

Video Real-time Recognition

Tesseract.js works in the browser using webpack, esm, or plain script tags with a CDN and on the server with Node.js. After you install it, using it is as simple as:

import { createWorker } from 'tesseract.js';

(async () \=> {
  const worker \= await createWorker('eng');
  const ret \= await worker.recognize('https://tesseract.projectnaptha.com/img/eng\_bw.png');
  console.log(ret.data.text);
  await worker.terminate();
})();

When recognizing multiple images, users should create a worker once, run `worker.recognize` for each image, and then run `worker.terminate()` once at the end (rather than running the above snippet for every image).

Installation
------------

Tesseract.js works with a `<script>` tag via local copy or CDN, with webpack via `npm` and on Node.js with `npm/yarn`.

### CDN

<!-- v5 -->
<script src\='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tesseract.js@5/dist/tesseract.min.js'\></script\>

After including the script the `Tesseract` variable will be globally available and a worker can be created using `Tesseract.createWorker`.

Alternatively, an ESM build (used with `import` syntax) can be found at `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tesseract.js@5/dist/tesseract.esm.min.js`.

### Node.js

**Requires Node.js v14 or higher**

# For latest version
npm install tesseract.js
yarn add tesseract.js

# For old versions
npm install tesseract.js@3.0.3
yarn add tesseract.js@3.0.3

Project Scope
-------------

Tesseract.js aims to bring the Tesseract OCR engine (a separate project) to the browser and Node.js, and works by wrapping a WebAssembly port of Tesseract. This project does not modify core Tesseract features. Most notably, **Tesseract.js does not support PDF files and does not modify the Tesseract recognition model to improve accuracy.**

If your project requires features outside of this scope, consider the Scribe.js library. Scribe.js is an alternative library created to accommodate common feature requests that are outside of the scope of this repo. Scribe.js includes improvements to the Tesseract recognition model and supports extracting text from PDF documents, among other features. For more information see Scribe.js vs. Tesseract.js.

If you have a project or example repo that uses Tesseract.js, feel free to add it to this list using a pull request. Examples submitted should be well documented such that new users can run them; projects should be functional and actively maintained.

Major changes in v6
-------------------

Version 6 changes are documented in this issue. Highlights are below.

-   Fixed memory leak in previous versions
-   Overall reductions in runtime and memory usage
-   Breaking changes:
    -   All outputs formats other than `text` are disabled by default.
        -   To re-enable the `hocr` output (for example), set the following: `worker.recognize(image, {}, { hocr: true })`
    -   Minor changes to the structure of the JavaScript object (`blocks`) output
    -   See this issue for full list

Major changes in v5
-------------------

Version 5 changes are documented in this issue. Highlights are below.

-   Significantly smaller files by default (54% smaller for English, 73% smaller for Chinese)
    -   This results in a ~50% reduction in runtime for first-time users (who do not have the files cached yet)
-   Significantly lower memory usage
-   Breaking changes:
    -   `createWorker` arguments changed
        -   Setting non-default language and OEM now happens in `createWorker`
            -   E.g. `createWorker("chi_sim", 1)`
    -   `worker.initialize` and `worker.loadLanguage` functions should be deleted from code
    -   See this issue for full list

Upgrading from v2 to v5? See this guide.

Major changes in v4
-------------------

Version 4 includes many new features and bug fixes--see this issue for a full list. Several highlights are below.

-   Added rotation preprocessing options (including auto-rotate) for significantly better accuracy
-   Processed images (rotated, grayscale, binary) can now be retrieved
-   Improved support for parallel processing (schedulers)
-   Breaking changes:
    -   `createWorker` is now async
    -   `getPDF` function replaced by `pdf` recognize option

Contributing

### Development

To run a development copy of Tesseract.js do the following:

# First we clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js.git
cd tesseract.js

# Then we install the dependencies
npm install

# And finally we start the development server
npm start

The development server will be available at http://localhost:3000/examples/browser/basic-efficient.html in your favorite browser. It will automatically rebuild `tesseract.min.js` and `worker.min.js` when you change files in the **src** folder.

### Building Static Files

To build the compiled static files just execute the following:

npm run build

This will output the files into the `dist` directory.

### Run Tests

**Always confirm the automated tests pass before submitting a pull request.** To run the automated tests locally, run the following commands.

npm run lint
npm run test
