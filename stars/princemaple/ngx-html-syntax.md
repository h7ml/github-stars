Ngx (Angular2+) HTML Syntax for SublimeText
===========================================

based on the official sublime html syntax

Features
--------

So that it's not broken when there are

-   `[input]`
-   `[@animation]`
-   `(output)`
-   `(@animation.event)`
-   `#reference`
-   `*template`
-   `[(bananaBox)]`

attributes on the tags

Plus
----

Highlighting the JS part as JS. So,

-   in `[myBinding]="myVar"`, you should see `myVar` as an JS variable instead of string content
    -   i.e. `myVar` should be highlighted differently from `"`s
-   in `*ngFor="let column of columns"`, you should see `let` and `of` highlighted as keywords
-   in `(change)="update()"`, you should see `update` as function name
-   in `a && b` within an Angular expression, you should see `&&` correctly highlighted as the JS operator instead of an error you would see in normal HTML syntax.
-   in `{{1 + 2}}` interpolations, you should see JS syntax highlighting as well

And...
------

Now it supports Angular control flow.

```
@let myVar = myObservable | async;
```

```
@for (item of items) {
  <a [href]="item.link">{{item.title}}</a>
} @empty {
  <p>No Items</p>
}
```

```
@if (users$ | async; as users) {
  {{ users.length }}
}
```

```
@if (a > b) {
  {{a}} is greater than {{b}}
} @else if (b > a) {
  {{a}} is less than {{b}}
} @else {
  {{a}} is equal to {{b}}
}
```

```
@switch (condition) {
  @case (caseA) {
    Case A.
  }
  @case (caseB) {
    Case B.
  }
  @default {
    Default case.
  }
}
```

How to use
----------

The syntax is listed as `Ngx HTML` in Sublime syntax selection list.

I personaly use ApplySyntax plugin with the following setting:

"syntaxes": \[
    {
        "syntax": "Ngx HTML/NgxHTML",
        "extensions": \["component.html"\],
    },
\]

You could use it in other ways... e.g. set it as the default syntax for all html files, since it's a superset of the html syntax anyway.
