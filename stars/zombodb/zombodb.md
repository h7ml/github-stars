###### Making Postgres and Elasticsearch work together like it's 2023

Readme
------

ZomboDB brings powerful text-search and analytics features to Postgres by using Elasticsearch as an index type. Its comprehensive query language and SQL functions enable new and creative ways to query your relational data.

From a technical perspective, ZomboDB is a 100% native Postgres extension written in Rust with PGRX. ZomboDB uses Postgres's Index Access Method API to directly manage and optimize ZomboDB's specialized indices. As a native Postgres index type, ZomboDB allows you to `CREATE INDEX ... USING zombodb` on your existing Postgres tables. At that point, ZomboDB takes over and fully manages the remote Elasticsearch index, guaranteeing transactionally-correct text-search query results.

ZomboDB is fully compatible with all of Postgres's query plan types and most SQL commands such as `CREATE INDEX`, `COPY`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `SELECT`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `REINDEX`, `(auto)VACUUM`, etc.

It doesn’t matter if you’re using an Elasticsearch cloud provider or managing your own cluster -- ZomboDB communicates with Elasticsearch via its RESTful APIs so you’re covered either way.

ZomboDB allows you to use the power and scalability of Elasticsearch directly from Postgres. You don’t have to manage transactions between Postgres and Elasticsearch, asynchronous indexing pipelines, complex reindexing processes, or multiple data-access code paths -- ZomboDB does it all for you.

Quick Overview
--------------

Note that this is just a quick overview. Please read the getting started tutorial for more details.

Create the extension:

CREATE EXTENSION zombodb;

Create a table:

CREATE TABLE products (
    id SERIAL8 NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    name text NOT NULL,
    keywords varchar(64)\[\],
    short\_summary text,
    long\_description zdb.fulltext, 
    price bigint,
    inventory\_count integer,
    discontinued boolean default false,
    availability\_date date
);

\-- insert some data

Create a ZomboDB index:

CREATE INDEX idxproducts 
          ON products 
       USING zombodb ((products.\*)) 
        WITH (url\='localhost:9200/');

Query it:

SELECT \* 
  FROM products 
 WHERE products \==> '(keywords:(sports OR box) OR long\_description:"wooden away"~5) AND price:\[1000 TO 20000\]';

History
-------

The name is an homage to zombo.com and its long history of continuous self-affirmation.

Historically, ZomboDB began in 2013 by Technology Concepts & Design, Inc as a closed-source effort to provide transaction-safe text-search on top of Postgres tables. While Postgres's full-text search features are useful, they're not necessarily adequate for 200-column-wide tables with 100 million rows, each containing large text content.

Initially built on Postgres's Foreign Data Wrapper API, ZomboDB quickly evolved into an index type so that queries are MVCC-safe and standard SQL can be used to query and manage indices.

Elasticsearch was chosen as the backing search index because of its horizontal scaling abilities, performance, and general ease of use.

ZomboDB was open-sourced in July 2015 and has since been used in numerous production systems of various sizes and complexity.
