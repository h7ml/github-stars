Flux version 2
==============

Flux is a tool for keeping Kubernetes clusters in sync with sources of configuration (like Git repositories and OCI artifacts), and automating updates to configuration when there is new code to deploy.

Flux version 2 ("v2") is built from the ground up to use Kubernetes' API extension system, and to integrate with Prometheus and other core components of the Kubernetes ecosystem. In version 2, Flux supports multi-tenancy and support for syncing an arbitrary number of Git repositories, among other long-requested features.

Flux v2 is constructed with the GitOps Toolkit, a set of composable APIs and specialized tools for building Continuous Delivery on top of Kubernetes.

Flux is a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) graduated project, used in production by various organisations and cloud providers.

Quickstart and documentation
----------------------------

To get started check out this guide on how to bootstrap Flux on Kubernetes and deploy a sample application in a GitOps manner.

For more comprehensive documentation, see the following guides:

-   Ways of structuring your repositories
-   Manage Helm Releases
-   Automate image updates to Git
-   Manage Kubernetes secrets with Flux and SOPS

If you need help, please refer to our **Support page**.

GitOps Toolkit
--------------

The GitOps Toolkit is the set of APIs and controllers that make up the runtime for Flux v2. The APIs comprise Kubernetes custom resources, which can be created and updated by a cluster user, or by other automation tooling.

You can use the toolkit to extend Flux, or to build your own systems for continuous delivery -- see the developer guides.
