Deploy your own APP
-------------------

1.  Install & Configure the GitHub App
2.  Create `.env` file following `example.env`, please check config section in your GitHub apps page
    1.  `APP_ID/PRIVATE_KEY/GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET/GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` is required, please check chatgptbot settings and fill them.
    2.  **`PRIVATE_KEY` is required, it should be encoded by `base64`**.(`console.log(Buffer.from(<PRIVATE_KEY>).toString('base64'))`).
    3.  `SESSION_TOKEN` is required, it is generated by `ChatGPT` website. You can get it following this step.
3.  Vercel Deploy (**recommend**), click to clone deploy. Copy `.env` file environment to vercel app environment-variables in setting page (for me it's `https://vercel.com/oceanlvr/chatgptbot/settings/environment-variables`)
4.  Edit the webhooks URL to `${vercelAPPURL}/api/github/webhooks`. For me it's https://chatgptbot.vercel.app/api/github/webhooks
5.  Type `/chatgpt` in an issue, chat with the bot

_step4: update webhook URL to your vercel app domain._

> **Note** This package will switch to using the official API once it's released.
