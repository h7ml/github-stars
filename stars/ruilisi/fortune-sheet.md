FortuneSheet
============

FortuneSheet is a drop-in javascript spreadsheet library that provides rich features like Excel and Google Sheets

English | 简体中文

Purpose
-------

The goal of `FortuneSheet` is to make a feature-rich, easy-to-configure online spreadsheet that you can use out-of-the-box.

This project is originated from Luckysheet and has inherited many code from it. Lots of efforts have done to translate the whole project to typescript (still in progress), and solved problems in the design of the original project.

We aim to make FortuneSheet powerful yet easy to maintain.

Communication
-------------

-   Discord English community
-   QQ Chinese community
-   Xiemala

Live demo

Take a look at the live demo at fortune-sheet-demo.

Attention
---------

Before stable release of 1.0, input data structure and APIs may change during development. If you encounter errors after upgrading a version, check Changelog and Migration Guide.

Improvements to Luckysheet
--------------------------

-   Written fully in typescript.
-   You can now use `import` / `require` to use the library.
    
    import { Workbook } from '@fortune-sheet/react'
    
-   Multiple instance on the same page is supported.
-   Dropped `jQuery` dependency, uses native `React` / `Vue` + `immer` to manage the dom and state.
-   Changed to a forked handsontable/formula-parser to handle formula calculations.
-   Optimized the dom structure.
-   Replaced icons from `iconfont` with SVGs, as `iconfont` icons are inconvenient to update for other maintainers.
-   No visible elements is created outside container.
-   Never stores data in the `window` object.

Features
--------

-   Data structure is mostly compatible with Luckysheet (see Migration Guide).
-   **Formatting**: style, text alignment and rotation, text truncation, overflow, automatic line wrapping, multiple data types, cell segmentation style, hyperlink
-   **Cells**: multiple selection, borders, fill, merge cells
-   **Row & column**: insert, delete, hide, sort and filter rows or columns
-   **Operation**: copy, paste, cut, hot keys
-   **Formulas & Functions**: Built-in formulas
-   **Import/export Excel**: plugin for .xlsx import and export
-   **Additional features**: supports images, comments, data verification and custom tools

Documentation

See detailed documentation at fortune-sheet-doc.

Get started (react)
-------------------

### Download and install the library

Using npm

npm install @fortune-sheet/react

Using pnpm

pnpm install @fortune-sheet/react

Using yarn

yarn add @fortune-sheet/react

### Create an HTML placeholder

<style\>
  html, body, #root {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
  }
</style\>
<div id\="root"\></div\>

**NOTE**: `width` and `height` doesn't have to be 100%, but should at least have a value. If set to `auto`, table area may not show.

### Render the sheet

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Workbook } from "@fortune-sheet/react";
import "@fortune-sheet/react/dist/index.css"

ReactDOM.render(
  <Workbook data\={\[{ name: "Sheet1" }\]} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

### Backend storage and collabration

Each time a user operates on the sheet, an array of `Op` will be emiited through `onOp` callback. An op describes how to modify the current data to reach the new data after the user's operation. For example, here is an op when user sets the cell font to be bold on cell A2.

\[
    {
        "op": "replace",
        "index": "0",
        "path": \["data", 1, 0, "bl"\],
        "value": 1
    }
\]

The op is useful for database modification and syncing state in online collabration.

A working example with `Express` (backend server) and `MongoDB` (data persistence) is avaiable in `backend-demo` folder.

Run it with `node index.js` and visit Collabration example (initialize data by visiting http://localhost:8081/init)

For detailed doc about `Op`, refer to fortune-sheet-doc

Migrating data from Luckysheet
------------------------------

The overall data structure of FortuneSheet is the same as Luckysheet, with some naming differences:

1.  sheet.index -> sheet.id
2.  sheet.calcChain\[\].id -> sheet.calcChain\[\].id
