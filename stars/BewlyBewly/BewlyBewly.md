Just make a few small changes to your Bilibili homepage.

üëã Introduction
---------------

Important

BewlyBewly mainly focuses on page adjustments and optimization rather than improving functionally and efficiency.

The dark mode will only be adapted to commonly used pages due to its efficiency and maintenance difficulty, while less frequently used pages will not to be adapted.

Caution

BLBewly is a free BewlyBewly extension on Safari. We thank ùó¶ùòÅùó≤ùòÉùó≤ ùïè for their help with the free publication of the app to Safari. However, issues encountered with the Safari version are outside of our maintenance scope, and we are not considering Safari maintenance.

Caution

If you are installing this extension, your browser will probably say that it can read your browser history.

This is because BewlyBewly uses the "tabs" permission, which can also be used to read each tab, allowing it to know the browsing history, but it is not utilized here.

**Some browsers will mention the worst-case scenario and the highest risks, ensuring your safety after installation.** Additionally, this project is open source, so you can see what exactly what it does.

BewlyBewly is a browser extension for BiliBili that aims to enhance the user experience by redesigning the BiliBili UI. The design is inspired by YouTube, Vision OS, and iOS, resulting in a more visually appealing and user-friendly interface. This project uses the vitesse-webext template for development. Without this template, it may not be possible to develop this project.
