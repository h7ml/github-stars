Compose Multiplatform is a declarative framework for sharing UI code across multiple platforms with Kotlin. It is based on Jetpack Compose and developed by JetBrains and open-source contributors.

You can choose the platforms across which to share your UI code using Compose Multiplatform:

-   iOS
-   Android
-   Desktop (Windows, MacOS, and Linux)
-   Web (Alpha)

For example, you can share UIs between iOS and Android or Windows and MacOS.

iOS
---

Compose Multiplatform shares most of its API with Jetpack Compose, the Android UI framework developed by Google. You can use the same APIs to build user interfaces for both Android and iOS.

Since Compose is built on top of Kotlin Multiplatform, you can easily access native APIs, such as the Camera API, and embed complex native UI views, such as MKMapView.

Android
-------

When Android is one of your targets, you get the same experience for Android as if you were developing an Android app using Jetpack Compose.

Desktop
-------

Compose Multiplatform targets the JVM and supports high-performance hardware-accelerated UI rendering on all major desktop platforms â€“ macOS, Windows, and Linux.

It has desktop extensions for menus, keyboard shortcuts, window manipulation, and notification management.

Web

> Web support is in Alpha. It may change incompatibly and require manual migration in the future. We would appreciate your feedback on it in the public Slack channel #compose-web. If you face any issues, please report them on YouTrack.

You can experiment with sharing your mobile or desktop UIs with the web. Compose for Web is based on Kotlin/Wasm, the newest target for Kotlin Multiplatform projects. It allows Kotlin developers to run their code in the browser with all the benefits that WebAssembly has to offer, such as good and predictable performance for your applications.
