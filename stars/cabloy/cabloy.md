What is CabloyJS
================

CabloyJS is a NodeJS full-stack framework with `workflow engine`, a low-code development platform for developers, is also a PAAS platform with both `out-of-the-box` and `flexible-customization`. Only one set of codes is needed to realize the `backend admin management system` and the `frontend applications` at the same time. And only one set of codes is needed to adapt to `PC` and `Mobile` at the same time, and the `Mobile` is close to the native experience

Features
--------

Each built-in feature of Cabloy has been carefully adjusted, which reflects the seamless connection of `flexible-customization` from `out-of-the-box`, including role system, user authentication, menu permission, data permission, form rendering, form verification, workflow engine, dictionary, dashboard, online push, page theme, multilingual internationalization and CMS rendering engine, etc.

Zova
----

Zova is a vue3 framework with ioc container. With the support of ioc container, defining reactive states no longer needs `ref/reactive`, nor `ref.value`

Zova is an independent front-end framework hatched in the process of developing Cabloy5. It uses TypeScript, using universal design, and can be used with any UI library
