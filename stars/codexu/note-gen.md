From Recording to Writing
-------------------------

Conventional note-taking applications typically don't provide recording functionality. Users need to manually copy and paste content for recording, which greatly reduces efficiency. When faced with scattered recorded content, it requires significant effort to organize.

NoteGen is divided into `Recording` and `Writing` pages, with the following relationship:

-   Recordings can be organized into notes and transferred to the writing page for in-depth composition.
-   During writing, you can insert recordings at any time.
