-   `PUT` - Updates an existing resource
-   `PATCH` - Very similar to `PUT` but makes a partial update on a resource
-   `DELETE` - Deletes resource or related component
-   `HEAD` - Retrieve response headers identical to those of a GET request, but without the response body.
-   `CONNECT` - Establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource
-   `OPTIONS` - Describe the communication options for the target resource
-   `TRACE` - Performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource
-   `<custom>` - Some APIs use custom request methods such as `LIST`. Type in your custom methods.
