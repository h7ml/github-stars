PixiJS is the fastest, most lightweight 2D library available for the web, working across all devices and allowing you to create rich, interactive graphics and cross-platform applications using WebGL and WebGPU.

### Setup

It's easy to get started with PixiJS! Just use our PixiJS Create CLI and get set up in just one command:

```
npm create pixi.js@latest
```

or to add it to an existing project:

```
npm install pixi.js
```

### Usage

import { Application, Assets, Sprite } from 'pixi.js';

(async () \=>
{
    // Create a new application
    const app \= new Application();

    // Initialize the application
    await app.init({ background: '#1099bb', resizeTo: window });

    // Append the application canvas to the document body
    document.body.appendChild(app.canvas);

    // Load the bunny texture
    const texture \= await Assets.load('https://pixijs.com/assets/bunny.png');

    // Create a bunny Sprite
    const bunny \= new Sprite(texture);

    // Center the sprite's anchor point
    bunny.anchor.set(0.5);

    // Move the sprite to the center of the screen
    bunny.x \= app.screen.width / 2;
    bunny.y \= app.screen.height / 2;

    app.stage.addChild(bunny);

    // Listen for animate update
    app.ticker.add((time) \=>
    {
        // Just for fun, let's rotate mr rabbit a little.
        // \* Delta is 1 if running at 100% performance \*
        // \* Creates frame-independent transformation \*
        bunny.rotation += 0.1 \* time.deltaTime;
    });
})();
