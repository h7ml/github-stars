PixiJS â€” The HTML5 Creation Engine
==================================

This project aims to provide a fast, lightweight 2D library that works across all devices. The PixiJS renderer allows everyone to enjoy the power of hardware acceleration without prior knowledge of WebGL. Also, it's fast. Really fast.

If you want to keep up to date with the latest PixiJS news then feel free to follow us on Twitter @PixiJS and we will keep you posted! You can also check back on our site as any breakthroughs will be posted up there too!

### What to Use PixiJS for and When to Use It

PixiJS is a rendering library that will allow you to create rich, interactive graphics and cross-platform applications and games without having to dive into the WebGL API or deal with browser and device compatibility.

PixiJS supports WebGPU with fallback support for WebGL. As a library, PixiJS is a fantastic tool for authoring interactive content. Use it for your graphics-rich, interactive websites, applications, and HTML5 games. Out-of-the-box, cross-platform compatibility and graceful degradation mean you have less work to do and more fun doing it! If you want to create polished and refined experiences relatively quickly without delving into dense, low-level code, all while avoiding the headaches of browser inconsistencies, then sprinkle your next project with some PixiJS magic!

**Boost your development and feel free to use your imagination!**

### Setup

It's easy to get started with PixiJS! Simply download a prebuilt build!

Alternatively, PixiJS can be installed with npm or simply using a content delivery network (CDN) URL to embed PixiJS directly on your HTML page.

#### NPM Install

npm install pixi.js

There is no default export. The correct way to import PixiJS is:

import \* as PIXI from 'pixi.js';

#### CDN Install

Via jsDelivr:

<script src\="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/pixi.js@8.x/dist/pixi.min.js"\></script\>

Or via unpkg:

<script src\="https://unpkg.com/pixi.js@8.x/dist/pixi.min.js"\></script\>

### Basic Usage Example

import { Application, Assets, Sprite } from 'pixi.js';

(async () \=>
{
    // Create a new application
    const app \= new Application();

    // Initialize the application
    await app.init({ background: '#1099bb', resizeTo: window });

    // Append the application canvas to the document body
    document.body.appendChild(app.canvas);

    // Load the bunny texture
    const texture \= await Assets.load('https://pixijs.com/assets/bunny.png');

    // Create a bunny Sprite
    const bunny \= new Sprite(texture);

    // Center the sprite's anchor point
    bunny.anchor.set(0.5);

    // Move the sprite to the center of the screen
    bunny.x \= app.screen.width / 2;
    bunny.y \= app.screen.height / 2;

    app.stage.addChild(bunny);

    // Listen for animate update
    app.ticker.add((time) \=>
    {
        // Just for fun, let's rotate mr rabbit a little.
        // \* Delta is 1 if running at 100% performance \*
        // \* Creates frame-independent transformation \*
        bunny.rotation += 0.1 \* time.deltaTime;
    });
})();
