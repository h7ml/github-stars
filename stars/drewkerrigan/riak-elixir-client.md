Riak Elixir Client
==================

A Riak client written in Elixir. Now includes connection pooling with pooler and a variety of other improvements from riex.

Setup
-----

### Prerequisites

-   Riak 2.0+
-   Elixir 1.0+

#### In an Elixir application

Add the following to mix.exs

...
def application do
  \[ applications: \[ :riak \]\]
end
...
defp deps do
  \[ {:riak, "~> 1.1.6"} \]
end
...

Usage
-----

### Establishing a Riak connection

{:ok, pid} \= Riak.Connection.start\_link('127.0.0.1', 8087) \# Default values

### Connection Pooling

Most functions in this module can be called by passing the pid of the established connection or using a pool of connections (provided by pooler). Define pools by using the group `riak`. Following is an example `config/config.exs`:

config :pooler, pools:
  \[
    \[
      name: :riaklocal1,
      group: :riak,
      max\_count: 10,
      init\_count: 5,
      start\_mfa: { Riak.Connection, :start\_link, \[\] }
    \], \[
      name: :riaklocal2,
      group: :riak,
      max\_count: 15,
      init\_count: 2,
      start\_mfa: { Riak.Connection, :start\_link, \['127.0.0.1', 9090\] }
    \]
  \]

For an example using this functionality with a local Riak instance, check `config/config.exs`. More information about Elixir configuration can be found on http://elixir-lang.org: Application environment and configuration.

Once a pool configuration is properly defined in a project, calls to Riak can omit the pid. For example:

This call uses a pid from the pool of connections provided by pooler:

Riak.delete("user", key)

This call requires a pid obtained by first calling `Riak.Connection.start_link`:

Riak.delete(pid, "user", key)

### Save a value

o \= Riak.Object.create(bucket: "user", key: "my\_key", data: "Han Solo")
Riak.put(pid, o)

### Find an object

o \= Riak.find(pid, "user", "my\_key")

### Update an object

o \= %{o | data: "Something Else"}
Riak.put(pid, o)

### Delete an object

Using key

Riak.delete(pid, "user", key)

Using object

Riak.delete(pid, o)

### Timeseries

Riak Timeseries functionality is available in TS 1.3.1 releases of Riak and greater.

#### Setup

Create a table:

```
riak-admin bucket-type create GeoCheckin '{"props":{"table_def": "CREATE TABLE GeoCheckin (region VARCHAR NOT NULL, state VARCHAR NOT NULL, time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL, weather VARCHAR NOT NULL, temperature DOUBLE, PRIMARY KEY ((region, state, QUANTUM(time, 15, 'm')), region, state, time))"}}'
riak-admin bucket-type activate GeoCheckin
```

#### Insert Rows

```
Riak.Timeseries.put("GeoCheckin", [
    {"region1", "state1", 25, "hot", 23.0},
    {"region2", "state99", 26, "windy", 19.0}
])
> :ok
```

#### Get a row by primary key

```
Riak.Timeseries.get("GeoCheckin", ["region1", "state1", 25])
> {["region", "state", "time", "weather", "temperature"], [{"region1", "state1", 25, "hot", 23.0}]}
```

#### Get all rows

_Note_: This is a very expensive operation for a loaded cluster

```
Riak.Timeseries.list!("GeoCheckin")
> [{"region1", "state1", 25, "hot", 23.0}, {"region2", "state99", 26, "windy", 19.0}]
```

#### Delete a row

```
Riak.Timeseries.delete("GeoCheckin", ["region2", "state99", 26])
> :ok
```

#### Query

```
Riak.Timeseries.query("select * from GeoCheckin where time > 24 and time < 26 and region = 'region1' and state = 'state1'")
> {["region", "state", "time", "weather", "temperature"], [{"region1", "state1", 25, "hot", 23.0}]}
```

### Datatypes

Riak Datatypes (a.k.a. CRDTs) are avaiable in Riak versions 2.0 and greater. The types included are: maps, sets, counters, registers and flags.

#### Setup

Datatypes require the use of bucket-types. Maps, sets, counters, and hyper-log-logs can be used as top-level bucket-type datatypes; Registers and flags may only be used within maps.

The following examples assume the presence of 4 datatype enabled bucket-types. You can create these bucket-types by running the following commands on a single Riak node in your cluster:

Bucket-Type: `counters`

```
riak-admin bucket-type create counters '{"props":{"datatype":"counter"}}'
riak-admin bucket-type activate counters
```

Bucket-Type: `sets`

```
riak-admin bucket-type create sets '{"props":{"datatype":"set"}}'
riak-admin bucket-type activate sets
```

Bucket-Type: `maps`

```
riak-admin bucket-type create maps '{"props":{"datatype":"map"}}'
riak-admin bucket-type activate maps
```

Bucket-Type: `hll`

```
riak-admin bucket-type create hll '{"props":{"datatype":"hll"}}'
riak-admin bucket-type activate hll
```

#### Counters

Create a counter (`alias Riak.CRDT.Counter`):

Counter.new
  |> Counter.increment
  |> Counter.increment(2)
  |> Riak.update("counters", "my\_counter\_bucket", "my\_key")

Fetch a counter:

counter \= Riak.find("counters", "my\_counter\_bucket", "my\_key")
  |> Counter.value

`counter` will be 3.

_**NOTE**_: "Counter drift" is a possibility that needs to be accounted for with any distributed system such as Riak. The problem can manifest itself during failure states in either your applicaiton or Riak itself. If an increment operation fails from the client's point of view, there is not sufficient information available to know whether or not that call made it to zero or all of the replicas for that counter object. As such, if the client attempts to retry the increment after recieving something like a error code 500 from Riak, that counter object is at risk of drifting positive. Similarly if the client decides not to retry, that counter object is at risk of drifting negative.

For these reasons, counters are only suggested for use-cases that can handle some (albeit small) amount of counter drift. Good examples of appropriate use-cases are: Facebook likes, Twitter retweet counts, Youtube view counts, etc. Some examples of poor use-cases for Riak counters are: bank account balances, anything related to money. It is possible to implement these types of solutions using Riak, but more client side logic is necessary. For an example of a client-side ledger with tunable retry options, check github.com/drewkerrigan/riak-ruby-ledger. Another approach could be the client-side implementation of a HAT (Highly Available Transaction) algorithm.

#### Sets

Create a set (`alias Riak.CRDT.Set`):

Set.new
  |> Set.put("foo")
  |> Set.put("bar")
  |> Riak.update("sets", "my\_set\_bucket", "my\_key")

And fetch the set:

set \= Riak.find("sets", "my\_set\_bucket", "my\_key")
  |> Set.value

Where `set` is an `orddict`.

#### Maps

Maps handle binary keys with any other datatype (map, set, flag, register and counter).

Create a map (`alias Riak.CRDT.Map`):

register \= Register.new("some string")
flag \= Flag.new |> Flag.enable
Map.new
  |> Map.put("k1", register)
  |> Map.put("k2", flag)
  |> Riak.update("maps", "my\_map\_bucket", "map\_key")

And fetch the map:

map \= Riak.find("maps", "my\_map\_bucket", key) |> Map.value

Where `map` is an `orddict`.

#### Hyper Log Logs

The use case for this type is counting distinct elements in a monotonic way. I think of it as like a counter for customers visited but once a customer visits the counter will never go up again. It also isn't possible to remove a element once it has been added to the log.

Create a HLL (`alias Riak.CRDT.HyperLogLog`):

HyperLogLog.new
  |> HyperLogLog.add\_element("foo")
  |> Riak.update("hll", "my\_hll\_bucket", "hll\_key")

And fetch the distinct count:

hll \= Riak.find("hll", "my\_hll\_bucket", "hll\_key") |> HLL.value

Where `hll` is an `integer`.

Examples
--------

Check the `examples/` directory for a few example elixir applications using the riak client.

For more functionality, check `test/` directory.

Tests
-----

```
MIX_ENV=test mix do deps.get, test
```

_**NOTE:**_ If you see errors related to `{:error, :nil_object}`, Ensure that you have created and activated the below `map`, `set`, and `counter` bucket types.

_Note_

The creation of the following CRDT bucket-types is a prerequisite for passing the CRDT tests.

```
riak-admin bucket-type create maps '{"props":{"datatype":"map"}}'
riak-admin bucket-type activate maps
riak-admin bucket-type create sets '{"props":{"datatype":"set"}}'
riak-admin bucket-type activate sets
riak-admin bucket-type create counters '{"props":{"datatype":"counter"}}'
riak-admin bucket-type activate counters
riak-admin bucket-type create hll '{"props":{"datatype":"hll"}}'
riak-admin bucket-type activate hll
```

_Note_

The creation of this Timeseries table is a prerequisite for passing the Timeseries tests.

```
riak-admin bucket-type create GeoCheckin '{"props":{"table_def": "CREATE TABLE GeoCheckin (region VARCHAR NOT NULL, state VARCHAR NOT NULL, time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL, weather VARCHAR NOT NULL, temperature DOUBLE, PRIMARY KEY ((region, state, QUANTUM(time, 15, 'm')), region, state, time))"}}'
riak-admin bucket-type activate GeoCheckin
```
