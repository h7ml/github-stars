Ray is a unified framework for scaling AI and Python applications. Ray consists of a core distributed runtime and a set of AI libraries for simplifying ML compute:

Learn more about Ray AI Libraries:

-   Data: Scalable Datasets for ML
-   Train: Distributed Training
-   Tune: Scalable Hyperparameter Tuning
-   RLlib: Scalable Reinforcement Learning
-   Serve: Scalable and Programmable Serving

Or more about Ray Core and its key abstractions:

-   Tasks: Stateless functions executed in the cluster.
-   Actors: Stateful worker processes created in the cluster.
-   Objects: Immutable values accessible across the cluster.

Learn more about Monitoring and Debugging:

-   Monitor Ray apps and clusters with the Ray Dashboard.
-   Debug Ray apps with the Ray Distributed Debugger.

Ray runs on any machine, cluster, cloud provider, and Kubernetes, and features a growing ecosystem of community integrations.

Install Ray with: `pip install ray`. For nightly wheels, see the Installation page.

Why Ray?
--------

Today's ML workloads are increasingly compute-intensive. As convenient as they are, single-node development environments such as your laptop cannot scale to meet these demands.

Ray is a unified way to scale Python and AI applications from a laptop to a cluster.

With Ray, you can seamlessly scale the same code from a laptop to a cluster. Ray is designed to be general-purpose, meaning that it can performantly run any kind of workload. If your application is written in Python, you can scale it with Ray, no other infrastructure required.
