Every Programmer Should Know 🤔
===============================

A collection of (mostly) technical things every software developer should know.

☝️ _These are resources I can recommend to every programmer regardless of their skill level or tech stack_

Highly opinionated 💣. Not backed by science. Comes in no particular order ♻️

U like it? ⭐ it and share with a friendly developer! U don't like it? Watch the doggo 🐶

_P.S. You don't need to know all of that by heart to be a programmer. But knowing the stuff will help you become better! 💪_

_P.P.S. Contributions are welcome!_

### Platform Engineering

> A modern discipline that evolved from DevOps and SRE principles, focused on improving developer experience and productivity by building and managing self-service tools and workflows, often through an Internal Developer Platform (IDP). The goal is to reduce cognitive load on developers and streamline the path to production.
