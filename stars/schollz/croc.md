About
-----

`croc` is a tool that allows any two computers to simply and securely transfer files and folders. AFAIK, _croc_ is the only CLI file-transfer tool that does **all** of the following:

-   Allows **any two computers** to transfer data (using a relay)
-   Provides **end-to-end encryption** (using PAKE)
-   Enables easy **cross-platform** transfers (Windows, Linux, Mac)
-   Allows **multiple file** transfers
-   Allows **resuming transfers** that are interrupted
-   No need for local server or port-forwarding
-   **IPv6-first** with IPv4 fallback
-   Can **use a proxy**, like Tor

For more information about `croc`, see my blog post or read a recent interview I did.

Install
-------

You can download the latest release for your system, or install a release from the command-line:

curl https://getcroc.schollz.com | bash

### On macOS

Using Homebrew:

brew install croc

Using MacPorts:

sudo port selfupdate
sudo port install croc

### On Windows

You can install the latest release with Scoop, Chocolatey, or Winget:

scoop install croc

choco install croc

winget install schollz.croc

### Using nix-env

You can install the latest release with Nix:

nix-env -i croc

### On NixOS

You can add this to your configuration.nix:

environment.systemPackages \= \[
  pkgs.croc
\];

### On Alpine Linux

First, install dependencies:

apk add bash coreutils
wget -qO- https://getcroc.schollz.com | bash

### On Arch Linux

Install with `pacman`:

pacman -S croc

### On Fedora

Install with `dnf`:

dnf install croc

### On Gentoo

Install with `portage`:

emerge net-misc/croc

### On Termux

Install with `pkg`:

pkg install croc

### On FreeBSD

Install with `pkg`:

pkg install croc

### On Linux, macOS, and Windows via Conda

You can install from conda-forge globally with `pixi`:

pixi global install croc

Or install into a particular environment with `conda`:

conda install --channel conda-forge croc

### On Linux, macOS via Docker

Add the following one-liner function to your ~/.profile (works with any POSIX-compliant shell):

croc() { \[ $# \-eq 0 \] && set -- ""; docker run --rm -it --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v "$(pwd):/c" -v "$HOME/.config/croc:/.config/croc" -w /c -e CROC\_SECRET schollz/croc "$@"; }

You can also just paste it in the terminal for current session. On first run Docker will pull the image. `croc` via Docker will only work within the current directory and its subdirectories.

### Build from Source

If you prefer, you can install Go and build from source (requires Go 1.22+):

go install github.com/schollz/croc/v10@latest

### On Android

There is a 3rd-party F-Droid app available to download.

Usage
-----

To send a file, simply do:

$ croc send \[file(s)-or-folder\]
Sending 'file-or-folder' (X MB)
Code is: code-phrase

Then, to receive the file (or folder) on another computer, run:

croc code-phrase

The code phrase is used to establish password-authenticated key agreement (PAKE) which generates a secret key for the sender and recipient to use for end-to-end encryption.

### Customizations & Options

#### Using `croc` on Linux or macOS

On Linux and macOS, the sending and receiving process is slightly different to avoid leaking the secret via the process name. You will need to run `croc` with the secret as an environment variable. For example, to receive with the secret `***`:

CROC\_SECRET=\*\*\* croc

For single-user systems, the default behavior can be permanently enabled by running:

croc --classic

#### Custom Code Phrase

You can send with your own code phrase (must be more than 6 characters):

croc send --code \[code-phrase\] \[file(s)-or-folder\]

#### Allow Overwriting Without Prompt

To automatically overwrite files without prompting, use the `--overwrite` flag:

croc --yes --overwrite <code\>

#### Excluding Folders

To exclude folders from being sent, use the `--exclude` flag with comma-delimited exclusions:

croc send --exclude "node\_modules,.venv" \[folder\]

#### Use Pipes - stdin and stdout

You can pipe to `croc`:

cat \[filename\] | croc send

To receive the file to `stdout`, you can use:

croc --yes \[code-phrase\] \> out

#### Send Text

To send URLs or short text, use:

croc send --text "hello world"

#### Use a Proxy

You can send files via a proxy by adding `--socks5`:

croc --socks5 "127.0.0.1:9050" send SOMEFILE

#### Change Encryption Curve

To choose a different elliptic curve for encryption, use the `--curve` flag:

croc --curve p521 <codephrase\>

#### Change Hash Algorithm

For faster hashing, use the `imohash` algorithm:

croc send --hash imohash SOMEFILE

#### Self-host Relay

You can run your own relay:

croc relay

By default, it uses TCP ports 9009-9013. You can customize the ports (e.g., `croc relay --ports 1111,1112`), but at least **2** ports are required.

To send files using your relay:

croc --relay "myrelay.example.com:9009" send \[filename\]

#### Self-host Relay with Docker

You can also run a relay with Docker:

docker run -d -p 9009-9013:9009-9013 -e CROC\_PASS='YOURPASSWORD' schollz/croc

To send files using your custom relay:

croc --pass YOURPASSWORD --relay "myreal.example.com:9009" send \[filename\]

Acknowledgements
----------------

`croc` has evolved through many iterations, and I am thankful for the contributions! Special thanks to:

-   @warner for the idea
-   @tscholl2 for the encryption gists
-   @skorokithakis for proxying two connections

And many more!
