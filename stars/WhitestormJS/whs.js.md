##### New releases

> `whs` is currently at v2 major version. We had plans for v3 yet but development isn't active. So v2 will probably remain the main stable version until further notice.

> We try to publish **minor update releases** for bug fixes, we will review PRs.

#### NPM

# Install npm version
$ npm install whs

> For `whs@2.2.x` (Three.js r92) use @beta tag

# Install npm version
$ npm install whs@beta

### Basic setup

Download the minified library or link the one from CDN

<script src\="js/three.min.js"\></script\>
<script src\="js/whs.min.js"\></script\>

The code below makes a `WHS.App` instance which handles all your modules and components for better work with `WebGL`. This one creates a _scene_, _camera_ and _renderer_ - we add the following modules to the App.

const app \= new WHS.App(\[
  new WHS.ElementModule(), // Apply to DOM.
  new WHS.SceneModule(), // Create a new THREE.Scene and set it to app.

  new WHS.DefineModule('camera', new WHS.PerspectiveCamera({ // Apply a camera.
    position: new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 50)
  })),

  new WHS.RenderingModule({bgColor: 0x162129}), // Apply THREE.WebGLRenderer
  new WHS.ResizeModule() // Make it resizable.
\]);

app.start(); // Run app.
