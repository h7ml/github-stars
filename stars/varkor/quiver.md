quiver: a modern commutative diagram editor
===========================================

**quiver** is a modern, graphical editor for commutative and pasting diagrams, capable of rendering high-quality diagrams for screen viewing, and exporting to LaTeX via tikz-cd or Typst via fletcher.

Creating and modifying diagrams with **quiver** is orders of magnitude faster than writing the equivalent LaTeX or Typst by hand and, with a little experience, competes with pen-and-paper. To learn how to use **quiver** efficiently, see the tutorial.

Try **quiver** out: q.uiver.app

For tips on using **quiver** (including how to create and modify diagrams entirely using the keyboard), see the **quiver** tutorial.

Features & screenshots
----------------------

**quiver** features an efficient, intuitive interface for creating complex commutative diagrams and pasting diagrams. It's easy to draw diagrams involving pullbacks and pushouts,

adjunctions,

and higher cells.

Object placement is based on a flexible grid that resizes according to the size of the labels.

There is a wide range of composable arrow styles.

And full use of colour for labels and arrows.

**quiver** is intended to look good for screenshots, as well as to export LaTeX and Typst that looks as close as possible to the original diagram.

Diagrams may be created and modified using either the mouse, by clicking and dragging, or using the keyboard, with a complete set of keyboard shortcuts for performing any action.

When you export diagrams to LaTeX or Typst, **quiver** will embed a link to the diagram, which will allow you to return to it later if you decide it needs to be modified, or to share it with others.

### Other features

-   Multiple selection, making mass changes easy and fast.
-   A history system, allowing you to undo/redo actions.
-   Support for custom macro definitions: simply paste a URL corresponding to the file containing your `\newcommand`s.
-   Export embeddable diagrams to HTML.
-   Panning and zooming, for large diagrams.
-   Smart label alignment and edge offset.

Editor integration
------------------

See Editor integration on the quiver wiki.

Building
--------

Run `make` from the command line, and then open `src/index.html` in your favourite web browser.

If this fails, you might be using an incompatible version of Make or Bash. In this case, you can manually download the latest release of KaTeX and place it under `src/` as `src/KaTeX/`. If KaTeX has not been given the correct path, you will get an error telling you that KaTeX failed to load.

**quiver** must be run through `localhost`. If you have Python installed, an easy solution is to run:

```
make serve
```

in the **quiver** directory and then open `localhost:8000` in browser.

If you have any other problems building **quiver**, open an issue detailing the problem and I'll try to help.
