About WeKan ®
-------------

WeKan ® is an completely Open Source and Free software collaborative kanban board application with MIT license.

Whether you’re maintaining a personal todo list, planning your holidays with some friends, or working in a team on your next revolutionary idea, Kanban boards are an unbeatable tool to keep your things organized. They give you a visual overview of the current state of your project, and make you productive by allowing you to focus on the few items that matter the most.

Since WeKan ® is a free software, you don’t have to trust us with your data and can install Wekan on your own computer or server. In fact we encourage you to do that by providing one-click installation on various platforms.

Requirements
------------

-   Enough disk space and alerts about low disk space. If you run out disk space, MongoDB database gets corrupted.
-   SECURITY: Updating to newest WeKan ® version very often. Please check you do not have automatic updates of Sandstorm or Snap turned off. Old versions have security issues because of old versions Node.js etc. Only newest WeKan ® is supported. WeKan ® on Sandstorm is not usually affected by any Standalone WeKan ® (Snap/Docker/Source) security issues.

-   Backups of WeKan ® database once a day miminum. Bugs, updates, users deleting list or card, harddrive full, harddrive crash etc can eat your data. There is no undo yet. Some bug can cause WeKan ® board to not load at all, requiring manual fixing of database content.
