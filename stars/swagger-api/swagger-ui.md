Introduction
------------

Swagger UI allows anyone ‚Äî be it your development team or your end consumers ‚Äî to visualize and interact with the API‚Äôs resources without having any of the implementation logic in place. It‚Äôs automatically generated from your OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) Specification, with the visual documentation making it easy for back end implementation and client side consumption.

General
-------

**üëâüèº Want to score an easy open-source contribution?** Check out our Good first issue label.

**üï∞Ô∏è Looking for the older version of Swagger UI?** Refer to the _2.x_ branch.

This repository publishes three different NPM modules:

-   swagger-ui is a traditional npm module intended for use in single-page applications that are capable of resolving dependencies (via Webpack, Browserify, etc.).
-   swagger-ui-dist is a dependency-free module that includes everything you need to serve Swagger UI in a server-side project, or a single-page application that can't resolve npm module dependencies.
-   swagger-ui-react is Swagger UI packaged as a React component for use in React applications.

We strongly suggest that you use `swagger-ui` instead of `swagger-ui-dist` if you're building a single-page application, since `swagger-ui-dist` is significantly larger.

If you are looking for plain ol' HTML/JS/CSS, download the latest release and copy the contents of the `/dist` folder to your server.

Compatibility
-------------

The OpenAPI Specification has undergone 5 revisions since initial creation in 2010. Compatibility between Swagger UI and the OpenAPI Specification is as follows:

Anonymized analytics
--------------------

SwaggerUI uses Scarf to collect anonymized installation analytics. These analytics help support the maintainers of this library and ONLY run during installation. To opt out, you can set the `scarfSettings.enabled` field to `false` in your project's `package.json`:

```
// package.json
{
  // ...
  "scarfSettings": {
    "enabled": false
  }
  // ...
}
```

Alternatively, you can set the environment variable `SCARF_ANALYTICS` to `false` as part of the environment that installs your npm packages, e.g., `SCARF_ANALYTICS=false npm install`.
