Requirements
------------

A fresh VM running any of the following operating systems:

-   Ubuntu 22.04 / 24.04 (amd64/arm64) - Any currently supported release
-   Debian 11+ (amd64/arm64)

An SSH keypair that can be used for application deployment. If this exists before installation, it will be automatically imported into dokku. Otherwise, you will need to import the keypair manually after installation using `dokku ssh-keys:add`.

Installation
------------

To install the latest stable release, run the following commands as a user who has access to `sudo`:

wget -NP . https://dokku.com/install/v0.36.0/bootstrap.sh
sudo DOKKU\_TAG=v0.36.0 bash bootstrap.sh

You can then proceed to configure your server domain (via `dokku domains:set-global`) and user access (via `dokku ssh-keys:add`) to complete the installation.

If you wish for a more unattended installation method, see these docs.
