Self-hosting Screenity
----------------------

> 🛠️ Note: When self-hosted, the extension runs entirely in local-only mode.  
> No API calls, sign-in flows, or platform features are enabled, nothing is sent anywhere.  
> Some internal code paths connect to Screenity Pro, but these are only active in the official Chrome Store version.

You can run Screenity locally without having to install it from the Chrome Store. Here's how:

1.  Download the latest Build.zip from the releases page
2.  Load the extension by pasting `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar, and enabling developer mode.
3.  Drag the folder that contains the code (make sure it's a folder and not a ZIP file, so unzip first), or click on the "Load unpacked" button and locate the folder.
4.  That's it, you should now be able to use Screenity locally. Follow these instructions to set up the Google Drive integration.

Self-hosting is totally fine for personal, educational, or internal use. If you’re thinking of building a commercial product from this, feel free to reach out, I’m open to chatting 💜

Creating a development version
------------------------------

> ❗️ Note that the license has changed to GPLv3 for the current MV3 version (Screenity version 3.0.0 and higher). Make sure to read the license and the Terms of Service regarding intellectual property.

1.  Check if your Node.js version is >= **14**.
2.  Clone this repository.
3.  Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4.  Run `npm start` to start the local development server.
5.  Open `chrome://extensions/` in your browser and enable developer mode.
6.  Click **Load unpacked** and select the `build` folder.
7.  The extension should now be available locally.  
    To rebuild after code changes, run `npm run build`.

### Enabling Save to Google Drive

To enable the Google Drive Upload (authorization consent screen) you must change the client\_id in the manifest.json file with your linked extension key.

You can create it accessing Google Cloud Console and selecting Create Credential > OAuth Client ID > Chrome App. To create a persistent extension key, you can follow the steps detailed here.
