Flowy
=====

  
A javascript library to create pretty flowcharts with ease ‚ú®

Installation
------------

Adding Flowy to your WebApp is incredibly simple:

1.  Link `flowy.min.js` and `flowy.min.css` to your project. Through jsDelivr:

<link rel\="stylesheet" href\="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/alyssaxuu/flowy/flowy.min.css"\> 
<script src\="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/alyssaxuu/flowy/flowy.min.js"\></script\>

1.  Create a canvas element that will contain the flowchart (for example, `<div id="canvas"></div>`)
2.  Create the draggable blocks with the `.create-flowy` class (for example, `<div class="create-flowy">Grab me</div>`)

Running Flowy
-------------

### Initialization

flowy(canvas, ongrab, onrelease, onsnap, onrearrange, spacing\_x, spacing\_y);

Parameter

Type

Description

`canvas`

_javascript DOM element_

The element that will contain the blocks

`ongrab`

_function_ (optional)

Function that gets triggered when a block is dragged

`onrelease`

_function_ (optional)

Function that gets triggered when a block is released

`onsnap`

_function_ (optional)

Function that gets triggered when a block snaps with another one

`onrearrange`

_function_ (optional)

Function that gets triggered when blocks are rearranged

`spacing_x`

_integer_ (optional)

Horizontal spacing between blocks (default 20px)

`spacing_y`

_integer_ (optional)

Vertical spacing between blocks (default 80px)

To define the blocks that can be dragged, you need to add the class `.create-flowy`

### Example

**HTML**

<div class\="create-flowy"\>The block to be dragged</div\>
<div id\="canvas"\></div\>

**Javascript**

var spacing\_x \= 40;
var spacing\_y \= 100;
// Initialize Flowy
flowy(document.getElementById("canvas"), onGrab, onRelease, onSnap, onRearrange, spacing\_x, spacing\_y);
function onGrab(block){
	// When the user grabs a block
}
function onRelease(){
	// When the user releases a block
}
function onSnap(block, first, parent){
	// When a block snaps with another one
}
function onRearrange(block, parent){
	// When a block is rearranged
}

Callbacks
---------

In order to use callbacks, you need to add the functions when initializing Flowy, as explained before.

### On grab

function onGrab(block){
	// When the user grabs a block
}

Gets triggered when a user grabs a block with the class `create-flowy`

Parameter

Type

Description

`block`

_javascript DOM element_

The block that has been grabbed

### On release

function onRelease(){
	// When the user lets go of a block
}

Gets triggered when a user lets go of a block, regardless of whether it attaches or even gets released in the canvas.

### On snap

function onSnap(block, first, parent){
	// When a block can attach to a parent
	return true;
}

Gets triggered when a block can attach to another parent block. You can either prevent the attachment, or allow it by using `return true;`

Parameter

Type

Description

`block`

_javascript DOM element_

The block that has been grabbed

`first`

_boolean_

If true, the block that has been dragged is the first one in the canvas

`parent`

_javascript DOM element_

The parent the block can attach to

### On rearrange

function onRearrange(block, parent){
	// When a block is rearranged
	return true;
}

Gets triggered when blocks are rearranged and are dropped anywhere in the canvas, without a parent to attach to. You can either allow the blocks to be deleted, or prevent it and thus have them re-attach to their previous parent using `return true;`

Parameter

Type

Description

`block`

_javascript DOM element_

The block that has been grabbed

`parent`

_javascript DOM element_

The parent the block can attach to

Methods
-------

### Get the flowchart data

// As an object
flowy.output();
// As a JSON string
JSON.stringify(flowy.output());

The JSON object that gets outputted looks like this:

{
	"html": "",
	"blockarr": \[\],
	"blocks": \[
		{
			"id": 1,
			"parent": 0,
			"data": \[
				{
				"name": "blockid",
				"value": "1"
				}
			\],
			"attr": \[
				{
				"id": "block-id",
				"class": "block-class"
				}
			\]
		}
	\]
}

Here's what each property means:

Key

Value type

Description

`html`

_string_

Contains the canvas data

`blockarr`

_array_

Contains the block array generated by the library (for import purposes)

`blocks`

_array_

Contains the readable block array

`id`

_integer_

Unique value that identifies a block

`parent`

_integer_

The `id` of the parent a block is attached to (-1 means the block has no parent)

`data`

_array of objects_

An array of all the inputs within a certain block

`name`

_string_

The name attribute of the input

`value`

_string_

The value attribute of the input

`attr`

_array of objects_

Contains all the data attributes of a certain block

### Import the flowchart data

flowy.import(output)

Allows you to import entire flowcharts initially exported using the previous method, `flowy.output()`

Parameter

Type

Description

`output`

_javascript DOM element_

The data from `flowy.output()`

#### Warning

This method accepts raw HTML and does **not** sanitize it, therefore this method is vulnerable to XSS. The _only_ safe use for this method is when the input is **absolutely** trusted, if the input is _not_ to be trusted the use this method can introduce a vulnerability in your system.

### Delete all blocks

To remove all blocks at once use:

flowy.deleteBlocks()

Currently there is no method to individually remove blocks. The only way to go about it is by splitting branches manually.
