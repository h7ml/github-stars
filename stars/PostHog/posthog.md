PostHog is an all-in-one, open source platform for building successful products
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PostHog provides every tool you need to build a successful product including:

-   Product analytics: Autocapture or manually instrument event-based analytics to understand user behavior and analyze data with visualization or SQL.
-   Web analytics: Monitor web traffic and user sessions with a GA-like dashboard. Easily monitor conversion, web vitals, and revenue.
-   Session replays: Watch real user sessions of interactions with your website or mobile app to diagnose issues and understand user behavior.
-   Feature flags: Safely roll out features to select users or cohorts with feature flags.
-   Experiments: Test changes and measure their statistical impact on goal metrics. Set up experiments with no-code too.
-   Error tracking: Track errors, get alerts, and resolve issues to improve your product.
-   Surveys: Ask anything with our collection of no-code survey templates, or build custom surveys with our survey builder.
-   Data warehouse: Sync data from external tools like Stripe, Hubspot, your data warehouse, and more. Query it alongside your product data.
-   Data pipelines: Run custom filters and transformations on your incoming data. Send it to 25+ tools or any webhook in real time or batch export large amounts to your warehouse.
-   LLM observability: Capture traces, generations, latency, and cost for your LLM-powered app.

Best of all, all of this is free to use with a generous monthly free tier for each product. Get started by signing up for PostHog Cloud US or PostHog Cloud EU.

Getting started with PostHog
----------------------------

### PostHog Cloud (Recommended)

The fastest and most reliable way to get started with PostHog is signing up for free toÂ PostHog Cloud or PostHog Cloud EU. Your first 1 million events, 5k recordings, 1M flag requests, 100k exceptions, and 250 survey responses are free every month, after which you pay based on usage.

### Self-hosting the open-source hobby deploy (Advanced)

If you want to self-host PostHog, you can deploy a hobby instance in one line on Linux with Docker (recommended 4GB memory):

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posthog/posthog/HEAD/bin/deploy-hobby)"

Open source deployments should scale to approximately 100k events per month, after which we recommend migrating to a PostHog Cloud.

We _do not_ provide customer support or offer guarantees for open source deployments. See our self-hosting docs, troubleshooting guide, and disclaimer for more info.
