Q&A

**1\. Why does Topit need screen recording and accessibility permissions?**

> Topit uses the accessibility permissions and screen recording permissions to control and capture your windows.

**2\. Does Topit consume a lot of power?**

> Topit uses ScreenCapture Kit to capture windows with a lower CPU overhead. But it may still drain the battery faster when you pin too many windows.
