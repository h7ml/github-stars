What is CockroachDB?
--------------------

CockroachDB is a distributed SQL database built on a transactional and strongly-consistent key-value store. It **scales** horizontally; **survives** disk, machine, rack, and even datacenter failures with minimal latency disruption and no manual intervention; supports **strongly-consistent** ACID transactions; and provides a familiar **SQL** API for structuring, manipulating, and querying data.

For more details, see our FAQ or architecture document.

Docs

For guidance on installation, development, deployment, and administration, see our User Documentation.

Starting with CockroachCloud
----------------------------

We can run CockroachDB for you, so you don't have to run your own cluster.

See our online documentation: Quickstart with CockroachCloud

Starting with CockroachDB
-------------------------

1.  Install CockroachDB: using a pre-built executable or build it from source.
2.  Start a local cluster and connect to it via the built-in SQL client.
3.  Learn more about CockroachDB SQL.
4.  Use a PostgreSQL-compatible driver or ORM to build an app with CockroachDB.
5.  Explore core features, such as data replication, automatic rebalancing, and fault tolerance and recovery.

Client Drivers
--------------

CockroachDB supports the PostgreSQL wire protocol, so you can use any available PostgreSQL client drivers to connect from various languages.

-   For recommended drivers that we've tested, see Install Client Drivers.
-   For tutorials using these drivers, as well as supported ORMs, see Example Apps.

Deployment
----------

-   CockroachCloud - Steps to create a free CockroachCloud cluster on your preferred Cloud platform.
-   Manual - Steps to deploy a CockroachDB cluster manually on multiple machines.
-   Cloud - Guides for deploying CockroachDB on various cloud platforms.
-   Orchestration - Guides for running CockroachDB with popular open-source orchestration systems.
