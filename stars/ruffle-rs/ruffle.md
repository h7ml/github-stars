Project status
--------------

Ruffle supports ActionScript 1, 2 and 3 pretty well, but it's still not finished by any means. Please report any issues in the Issue Tracker.

Using Ruffle
------------

The easiest way to try out Ruffle is to visit the web demo page, then click the "Select File" button to load a SWF file of your choice.

Nightly builds of Ruffle are available for desktop and web platforms.

For more detailed instructions, see our wiki page.

Building from source
--------------------

### Prerequisites

-   Latest stable channel of Rust
-   Java, available on your PATH as `java` (required for building the library containing the builtin Flash classes for ActionScript 3)

### Linux prerequisites

The following are typical dependencies for Linux:

-   libasound2-dev
-   libudev-dev
-   default-jre-headless
-   g++

### Desktop

#### Build

Use the following command to build and run the desktop app:

`cargo run --release --package=ruffle_desktop`

To run a specific SWF file, pass the SWF path as an argument:

`cargo run --release --package=ruffle_desktop -- test.swf`

To build in debug mode, simply omit `--release` from the command.

#### macOS

Ruffle desktop can be built from our Homebrew Tap:

`brew install --HEAD ruffle-rs/ruffle/ruffle`

_Note: because it is HEAD-only, you'll need to run `brew upgrade --fetch-HEAD ruffle` each time you want to update._

### Web or Extension

Follow the instructions in the web directory for building either the web or browser extension version of Ruffle.

This project is tested with BrowserStack.

### Android

Follow the instructions in the `ruffle-android` project for building the Android application of Ruffle.

### Scanner

If you have a collection of "real world" SWFs to test against, the scanner may be used to benchmark ruffle's parsing capabilities. Provided with a folder and an output filename, it will attempt to read all of the Flash files and report on the success of such a task.

`cargo run --release --package=ruffle_scanner -- scan folder/with/swfs/ results.csv`

### Exporter

If you have a SWF file and would like to capture an image of it, you may use the exporter tool. This currently requires hardware acceleration, but can be run headless (with no window).

-   `cargo run --release --package=exporter -- path/to/file.swf`
-   `cargo run --release --package=exporter -- path/to/file.swf path/to/screenshots --frames 5`

Structure
---------

-   `core` - core emulator and common code
-   `swf` - SWF and ActionScript parser
-   `desktop` - desktop client (uses `wgpu-rs`)
-   `web` - web client and browser extension (uses `wasm-bindgen`)
-   `render` - various rendering backends for both desktop and web
-   `video` - video decoding backends
-   `flv` - Flash Video decoder
-   `wstr` - a Flash-compatible implementation of strings
-   `scanner` - a utility to bulk parse SWF files
-   `exporter` - a utility to generate PNG screenshots of a SWF file

Sponsors
--------

You can support the development of Ruffle via GitHub Sponsors. Your sponsorship will help to ensure the accessibility of Flash content for the future. Thank you!
